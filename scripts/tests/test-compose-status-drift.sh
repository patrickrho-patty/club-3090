# Asserts that the registry `status` field and the compose-header `Status:`
# enum can't silently diverge again. Three checks:
#   (a) every registry `status` is in the canonical enum (STATUS_VALUES);
#   (b) every registered compose's profile-schema `Status:` header maps to the
#       enum (i.e. it carries a canonical leading emoji — no "Working (with
#       Genesis)"-style non-enum strings);
#   (c) the registry `status` is consistent with its compose header.

# Force Python's UTF-8 mode (PEP 540) for every python3 this script runs.
# Repo sources are full of unicode (— × → ⚠), and without this a rig on a real
# non-UTF-8 locale (de_DE.iso88591 and friends) decodes reads, stdout AND argv
# with the locale codec, which crashes the launcher/emit paths (#779). Python
# already auto-enables UTF-8 mode for the C/POSIX locale, so this covers the
# case it does NOT: a genuine non-UTF-8, non-C locale. Exported, so child
# processes and nested scripts inherit it. Guarded by test-locale-utf8.sh.
