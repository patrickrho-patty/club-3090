# Dual 3090 — what changes when you add the second card

You have **2× RTX 3090s**. This page is the front door for picking a config and knowing what dual-card unlocks vs single. Model-specific deep dives (quants, Genesis, engine internals) live in the model directory — links at the bottom.

> **Model not in the configs below / want any HF safetensors repo?** → [`docs/PULL.md`](PULL.md): `scripts/pull.sh` evaluates any model against the KV math (honest, no download) and boots it if it passes. The curated configs on this page are the measured path; both work.

**NVLink auto-detection** (since 2026-05-14): the dual-card composes now auto-detect whether an NVLink bridge is present. If you have one, you get the NVLink-optimized path automatically. If not, PCIe mode is used. Override with `NVLINK_MODE=force_on|force_off` in your `.env`. See the "NVLink auto-detection" section below.

> **Have 3+ GPUs?** See [`MULTI_CARD.md`](MULTI_CARD.md) — derivation of TP=4 / TP=8 configs from `dual.yml`, valid TP values for Qwen3.6-27B (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10), and what scales vs what doesn't.

Un-gates when the bump PR lands. |

‡ **Decode numbers revised 2026-07-20 — same-session, fresh-boot A/B.** The headline figures are **canonical 262K, 2-boot means** (fast 73.1/71.2→72.2 narr, 90.1/90.8→90.4 code; max 67.5/71.1→69.3 narr, 87.2/92.6→89.9 code). Two boots because **single boots swing ~5 TPS on the code leg** (larger than the fast-vs-max gap) — do not re-derive a tier ranking from one draw. The tiers are **decode-tied at 262K** within that boot variance; note max degrades at full context (69 vs 71 narr at 32K) where its 1.13× KV pool is tight, while fast (2.37× pool) does not. The mechanism table below is from the matched 32K on/off A/B:

| tier | MTP **off** (pure weight-bandwidth) | MTP **on** (as shipped, 2 draws) | MTP multiplier (code) | draft accept |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fast (int4, 17.5 GB) | **70.3 / 69.8** | 70.1–71.0 / 89.4–93.7 | ×1.31 | 64.3–66.0% |
| max (fp8, 35 GB) | 47.5 / 47.4 | 71.2–71.3 / 87.4–94.3 | ×1.92 | 65.6–66.9% |

**Read:** int4 is the far faster *raw* decoder (+48%, exactly as weight-bandwidth predicts), but fp8 extracts nearly twice as much from speculative decoding — because its forward pass is more expensive, each accepted draft token saves more absolute work (accept rates are tied at ~65–66%, so this is *not* an acceptance effect). The two cancel, leaving the tiers decode-tied as shipped. Each tier's code leg swings 4–7 TPS between draws, so single-draw comparisons of these two are meaningless. **The prior 69/89 and 83/108 figures came from different benchmark sessions and should not have been compared** — cross-session TPS comparison is invalid on this rig (a 7%-wide session artifact was separately confirmed on the Tess line the same week).

† **8-pack A/B (`--full`, same harness, 2026-06-07):** fast `109/150` · balanced `105/150` · max `110/150` — a **tie** (deterministic packs 64/64/65; the spread is within ±5–7 8-pack noise). The short-context 8-pack does **not** separate the three quants. Measured KV pools (v0.22.0 @262K, TP=2): **fast 622K/2.37× > balanced 370K/1.41× > max 295K/1.13×** — the fast tier's lighter 17.5 GB autoround weights give it the *biggest* pool too, so it isn't just the quality default, it's also the speed *and* headroom leader. (Earlier `129/150` for the fast tier was the 2026-05-09 harness, before benchlocal-cli verifier fixes — not comparable to today's numbers.) **Resolution (2026-07-16):** the "open follow-up" this note used to point at — does int8-PTH KV *fidelity* justify a tier? — was answered by [#594](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/594): int8-PTH **craters decode at depth** at *equal* NIAH recall, so the fidelity bet lost on both axes. `dual-max` survived by **flipping its KV to fp8/e4m3** (it still owns the real weight-fidelity axis: FP8 weights); `dual-balanced` had nothing left and is **deprecated**. The two-tier map (fast = speed+headroom, max = weight fidelity) is the shipped state. Trade-space background: [`QUANTIZATION.md` §4b](QUANTIZATION.md#4b-the-tier-trade-space--what-fast--balanced--max-actually-optimize).

¹ Single-card boot OOMs on Ampere 24 GB regardless of KV format. Single-card Gemma 4 is feasible on 32 GB+ GPUs (validated on RTX 5090 32 GB by [@apnar](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/67#discussioncomment-16832042) — 160/215 TPS at 32K MTP, 150/261 at 12K DFlash). Tracked in [`docs/UPSTREAM.md`](UPSTREAM.md) row 78 + [#67](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/67).

> **VRAM column is per-card** under TP=2 (each card holds half the weights + half the KV; both cards' totals are nearly identical). For a 2× 20 GB rig (e.g. 2× 3080-20GB / 40 GB combined), `dual.yml` and `dual-turbo` should fit; `dual-dflash*` won't (FP16 KV + DFlash draft pushes per-card past 20 GB). Component breakdown in [`tools/charts/gen-vram.py`](../tools/charts/gen-vram.py).

Run any of these via `bash scripts/launch.sh` (interactive) or `bash scripts/switch.sh <variant>`.

## Rule of thumb: on dual cards, prioritize context over concurrency

The dual-card composes default to **the largest context the KV pool allows**, with `--max-num-seqs` left as a modest cap (typically 4) — not the other way round. The reasoning:

- **`--max-num-seqs` is a cap, not a reservation.** Setting it to 4 doesn't reserve 4× the context; it caps how many requests run at once. Short/medium requests still pack into the shared KV pool and run concurrently.
- **The KV pool size is fixed by VRAM, not by `--max-model-len`.** Raising the context ceiling does **not** shrink the pool (e.g. `gemma-bf16-mtp`'s pool is 196,527 tokens whether `--max-model-len` is 32K or 131K). So a higher ceiling is *nearly free* for typical traffic — it only lets a single request go bigger; it doesn't cost short-request concurrency.
- **Dual cards exist to unlock what single can't.** A 2× 3090 rig's realistic workload is one or two long-context agents, not high-QPS multitenancy. If you want pure concurrency-at-low-ctx, a single-card compose or a replica is the better fit.

**So the default ceiling is set high; lower `--max-num-seqs` (to 2 or 1) only when you need a guarantee** — e.g. two concurrent long-context agents that must never preempt each other, or a single long request that must never be queued. The composes document the per-slug ladder (`gemma-int8-mtp`: 98K/4 → 170K/2 → 262K/1; `gemma-bf16-mtp`: 131K default, drop seqs for guaranteed-long).

> ⚠️ **The one exception is vision.** A large image *at* near-max context can OOM on thin headroom (e.g. `gemma-bf16-mtp` leaves only ~1.4 GB/card free at 120K single-stream). For vision-heavy long-context, lower `--max-num-seqs` or `--gpu-memory-utilization`. Vision at typical context is unaffected.

## Measured TPS on 2× 3090

![Qwen3.6-27B TPS — 2× 3090 configs (TP=2)](img/performance-dual.png)

Bench protocol: 3 warm + 5 measured runs of the canonical narrative + code prompts on each config. Substrate: vLLM nightly `0.20.1rc1.dev16+g7a1eb8ac2` + Genesis v7.69 dev tip (commit `2db18df`), RTX 3090 sm_86 PCIe-only at 230 W. Cliff 2 doesn't apply on TP=2 (DeltaNet GDN forward state splits across cards — 237K single-prompt verified on `dual.yml`); the v7.69 cutover is mostly a hygiene bump for `dual-turbo.yml` (its old workspace_lock sidecar is now covered by Genesis PN34 env-gate). Per-config run-by-run + VRAM peaks: [models/qwen3.6-27b/CHANGELOG.md](../models/qwen3.6-27b/CHANGELOG.md).

---

## VRAM budget on 2× 24 GB (TP=2)

![Per-card VRAM allocation, dual-card section](img/vram-budget-dual.png)

**Tensor parallelism (TP=2) splits weights AND KV symmetrically across both cards.** Each card holds ~7 GB of weights (vs ~14 GB on single-card) plus its half of the KV pool. That's why dual unlocks what single can't:

- 262K context + vision + 2 streams fits at ~23.6 GB / card on `dual.yml` (would need ~33 GB on a hypothetical single-card)
- DFlash draft adds ~1.75 GB / card (manageable across two cards; would crowd out KV on single)
- 4 concurrent streams via `dual-turbo` use TQ3 KV's compactness to fit 4 × full-context KV pools

For the single-card picture, see [`SINGLE_CARD.md`](SINGLE_CARD.md).

## Pick a config

### General default — `dual.yml`

**Workload:** anything. Chat, tool agents, vision, mixed-modal. The recommended default for 2× 3090.

> 🎯 **Don't want to name a slug?** `bash scripts/switch.sh qwen3.6-27b/default` (or a bare `bash scripts/launch.sh`) resolves the blessed dual-card default automatically — on 2× 3090 that's **`vllm/dual`** (the `dual` order in `ENGINE_PREFERENCE` is `vllm > ik-llama > llama.cpp`). Prefer a different config (e.g. `vllm/dual-turbo` for multi-tenant)? Pin it once with `bash scripts/switch.sh --set-default vllm/dual-turbo` and bare launches go straight there — see the [FAQ](FAQ.md#how-do-i-set-my-own-default-config).

262K context, fp8 KV, MTP n=3, 2 streams, vision tower active. **Genesis-less by design** — fp8 KV doesn't trigger the cudagraph bug (#40880) that drove Genesis's existence on single-card. Pure vLLM nightly path. Tool calls work via `--tool-call-parser qwen3_coder` + `--enable-auto-tool-choice`. All `verify-stress.sh` checks pass clean.

**When to pick:** the obvious starting point. Unless one of the specialized variants below names your exact workload, this is right. **Strongly recommended for IDE coding agents** (Cline / OpenCode / Roo / Claude Code / Cursor) — fp8 KV avoids the inductor compile-path leak that affects all 4 TQ3-KV variants. See [club-3090#16](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/16).

### Multi-tenant — `dual-turbo.yml`

**Workload:** small team or agent farm running 2-4 concurrent sessions. Open WebUI multi-user, GitHub-Actions-with-AI-PRs flows, batch agent runs.

262K + **TurboQuant 3-bit KV** + Genesis v7.69 PROD env-var stack + 4 streams. TQ3 packs each KV slot to ~3 bits/token (vs fp8's ~8 bits), which is what makes 4 × 262K pools fit on 2 cards. KV pool 1.52M tokens, max concurrency **4.67×**. Per-stream TPS lands at **58 narr / 76 code** (n=5, CV 3-5%), AL 3.39-3.51, MTP avg accept 79-84%, VRAM 19.8 GB / card.

**Concurrent throughput** (n=4 streams of the canonical code prompt, 2026-05-01 PM, vLLM v0.20 + Genesis v7.65 dev tip — re-bench against v7.69 pending but decode TPS regime unchanged by the bump): aggregate code TPS 269 across 4 streams (3.63× speedup over single-stream 74 TPS), per-stream mean 74 (CV 3.1%) — true parallel decoding, not interleaved. See `results/v0.20-migration/dual-turbo-concurrent.summary` for the run-by-run.

> ⚠️ **Decode-concurrent ≠ long-prefill-overlap** (see [#208](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/208)). The 269-TPS figure above is *decode-concurrent* — N short-prompt streams decoding together. A **different** regime, a **long prefill** (big tool result, file read, accumulated context) entering while another stream is *already decoding*, can **starve decode** to ~0.1–0.9 TPS until the prefill clears: chunked-prefill co-batches the heavy GDN/Mamba prefill chunk with the decode token into one forward step, and the `align` block floors the chunk at **1568 tokens** so it can't be tuned to zero. Observed on `dual.yml` (fp8); it's architectural to the hybrid model, so expect it on any dual-card chunked-prefill config. **So read 269 TPS as aggregate *throughput*, not a *latency* guarantee under agentic traffic.** Mitigations: lower `--max-num-batched-tokens` toward the 1568 floor to soften it (doesn't eliminate it); **proxy-level admission control** — gate large prefills away from live interactive decodes — is the real fix (`--scheduling-policy priority` does *not* help: it orders admission, not intra-step compute). Per-budget latency numbers pending a community A/B.

**When to pick:** real concurrent load. Solo users won't see the win on the per-stream curve — but per-stream TPS at n=4 is essentially the same as n=1 here (74 vs 76 TPS code), so this is also a viable single-stream config if you want max KV pool. Pick this if you ever serve >1 request at a time, or want the biggest single-card-equivalent context.

### Peak code TPS, with vision — `dual-dflash.yml` ⚠️ DEPRECATED (2026-05-31)

> **Deprecated — kept for historical reference.** Pruned 2026-05-31: superseded by `dual.yml` (262K + vision + 2 streams, stable image) and stranded on a [now-purged vLLM nightly](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/297). **DFlash on dual now lives on beellama** → `bash scripts/switch.sh --force beellama/qwen-dflash-dual` (Qwen3.6-27B, full 262K, v0.3.0 🧪 — pre-release, expect it to move). Full rationale: [#297](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/297). The numbers below are the original vLLM measurements.

**Workload:** code-heavy single-stream — fast iteration on quicksort-class problems, Cline going through a codebase, Cursor doing inline completions in a heavy file.

185K context (vs 262K — DFlash's draft model takes ~1.75 GB / card), FP16 KV (forced — DFlash's non-causal head_size=256 path requires fp16), DFlash N=5 draft model from Luce z-lab. **Code TPS lands at 125** vs `dual.yml`'s 89 — a real 40% jump on code prompts thanks to DFlash's higher acceptance length (AL ~4.4 vs MTP's 3.4).

**When to pick:** code is the dominant workload, you want TPS over context budget, vision is still required.

**⚠️ Prereq before this compose works:** download the DFlash draft model:
```bash
WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1 bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b
# OR manually:
hf download z-lab/Qwen3.6-27B-DFlash --local-dir <MODEL_DIR>/qwen3.6-27b-dflash
```
Without it, vLLM falls back silently to baseline bf16 decode (~25 TPS, not 125). Reported by [@lolren in #18](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/18#discussioncomment-16787831).

**Caveats:**
- DFlash's per-position acceptance falls off faster than MTP — narrative TPS (82) is good but not dramatically better than `dual.yml`'s 69. The win is concentrated on code/repetitive prompts.
- The z-lab draft is **still under training** (see [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md#luce-dflash-luce-orglucebox-hub--separate-llamacpp-fork-not-our-vllm-dual-dflash)). Published 125 TPS code is against the 2026-04-26 snapshot at peak code-prompt conditions; agent traffic with mixed code + narrative + tool schemas will see lower per-stream TPS until z-lab tags training-complete. **For autonomous coding agents (Cline / OpenCode / Pi / Claude Code) prefer `dual.yml` (FP8 + MTP) until then** — its 89 code TPS is robust across prompt shapes.

### Peak code TPS, no vision — `dual-dflash-noviz.yml` ⚠️ DEPRECATED (2026-05-31)

> **Deprecated** (same as the vision variant) — pruned 2026-05-31, on a purged nightly; DFlash on dual moved to beellama (`beellama/qwen-dflash-dual`). See [#297](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/297). Numbers below are the original vLLM measurements.

**Workload:** same as above, but no images. Squeezes another 15K of context out of the vision-tower's space.

200K context, FP16 KV, DFlash N=5, `--language-model-only`. Best code TPS in the lineup at **127**. Narrative is 78 (slight drop vs vision variant from compute distribution).

**When to pick:** pure-text code work where you'd rather have 200K than 185K. Drop vision wherever you don't need it.

## What dual-card unlocks (vs single)

| Want | Single-card status | Dual-card status |
|---|---|---|
| 262K context + vision | Works on `long-vision.yml` (192K) but Cliff 1 fires on big tool prefills | `dual.yml` — clean, 262K, no Cliff 1 |
| 4 concurrent streams at full context | Single-card serializes; can't fit | `dual-turbo.yml` — 4 streams, 262K each |
| DFlash N=5 spec-decode | Blocked: DFlash needs head_size=256 + non-causal which doesn't fit single-card head-dim split | `dual-dflash.yml` / `dual-dflash-noviz.yml` |
| Code TPS >100 | Best single-card is 67 code (default) | 125-127 code (DFlash variants) |
| Long single prompts safely | Cliff 2 fires at 50-60K on vLLM single-card (forces llama.cpp fallback at 21 TPS) | TP=2 splits activation across cards — **237K single-prompt verified** on `dual.yml` 2026-04-29 (~830 tok/s prefill, no OOM, peak 23.5 GB / card) |
| Big tool returns at 192K context | Cliff 1 fires on TQ3 paths regardless | `dual.yml` is below the cliff at 262K — activation budget is bigger per-card after split |

## Common pitfalls (dual-card specifics)

### Marlin pad-sub-tile-n patch (vendored, auto-applied)

The dual variants need a one-file patch — our fork of [vllm#40361](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40361) — for AutoRound W4A16 at TP=2, where output-dim shards fall below 64. **It's vendored in the repo and mounted automatically:** `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/patches/vllm-marlin-pad/{marlin.py,MPLinearKernel.py}` is overlaid read-only into the stock vLLM image by each dual compose. **No vLLM source clone, no extra setup** — it's in place the moment you launch a dual variant. When the upstream PR lands we'll drop the overlay.

### NVLink auto-detection

The dual-card composes automatically detect whether an NVLink bridge is installed and configure themselves accordingly. No separate compose files needed — `dual.yml`, `dual-turbo.yml`, `dual-dflash.yml`, and `dual-dflash-noviz.yml` all adapt to your hardware.

**How it works:** Each dual compose mounts `scripts/detect_nvlink.sh` and sources it in the entrypoint at container boot. The script checks `nvidia-smi topo -m` for NVLink links between GPUs, sets the correct NCCL env vars, and the entrypoint conditionally passes `--disable-custom-all-reduce` to vLLM.

**Override:** Set `NVLINK_MODE` in your `.env` (passed through to the container):
- `auto` (default) — detect via `nvidia-smi topo -m`
- `force_on` — assume NVLink bridge present, enable NVLink mode
- `force_off` — force PCIe-only path even if NVLink detected

Without NVLink, `--disable-custom-all-reduce` is passed to vLLM and `NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1` is set. With NVLink, custom all-reduce is enabled and NCCL uses the NVLink path. The gain is **workload-shaped**: small on single-stream **decode** (~2–5% on modern vLLM v0.24+ — the older ~15% figure was the v7.72.2 image), but large on **prefill / long-context** (~35–49%). So NVLink matters most for big-context / agentic movement, not short-prompt decode serving — prefill all-reduces the full activation tensor across TP=2 while decode only moves one token per step (cross-rig data in [BENCHMARKS.md](../BENCHMARKS.md), #698 / #77).

**No NVLink bridge?** You can still enable P2P over the PCIe bus on a patched driver (`NVLINK_MODE=pcie_p2p`) for a workload-dependent gain — and understand what your `nvidia-smi topo -m` output means — in [PCIE_P2P.md](PCIE_P2P.md).

### `dual.yml` is Genesis-less by design

The single-card cliffs (Cliff 1 / Cliff 2) and the cudagraph bug (#40880) that drove Genesis's existence don't fire on `dual.yml` — fp8 KV + 2 streams + 262K has plenty of headroom. So `dual.yml` runs **plain vLLM nightly** without any patch tree. If you want Genesis on dual (e.g. for `dual-turbo`'s TQ3 spec-verify path), it's structurally enabled there but absent from `dual.yml`.

### DFlash variants are FP16 KV (forced)

DFlash's `combine_hidden_states` path needs `head_size=256` + non-causal, which forces FP16 KV on Ampere — there's no fp8 / TurboQuant alternative for this path right now. Tracked at [vllm#40334](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40334). When that lands you can drop `--dtype bfloat16` and let dtype auto-detect.

### DFlash's vision compatibility

The DFlash draft + ViT path is documented and works (`--language-model-only` was historically required, now optional). `dual-dflash.yml` keeps vision; `dual-dflash-noviz.yml` drops it for an extra 15K ctx.

### Single-stream user on dual = small win

If you're solo-using on dual, you're paying for hardware that mostly sits idle on alternate GPUs during single-stream decode. The win shows up at concurrency or when you need DFlash. For solo users, single-card is often the better cost choice.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Setup (downloads model + Genesis patches, ~20 min cold). The dual marlin-pad
#    overlay is vendored in-repo and auto-mounted by the compose — no vLLM clone needed.
bash scripts/setup.sh qwen3.6-27b

# 2. Pick + boot via wizard (asks model + GPUs, projects VRAM budget, auto-picks TP=2 for matched 2× 3090)
bash scripts/launch.sh

# 3. Or skip the wizard:
bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/dual              # general default
bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/dual-turbo        # 4 streams
bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/dual-dflash       # peak code + vision
bash scripts/launch.sh --variant vllm/dual-dflash-noviz # peak code, no vision

# 4. Sanity test
curl -sf http://localhost:8020/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.6-27b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Capital of France?"}],"max_tokens":200}'

# 5. Switch later without re-running setup
bash scripts/switch.sh vllm/dual-dflash    # for example
bash scripts/switch.sh --list              # show all variants
```

## Performance summary

For variance, AL / accept rates, per-config row docstrings: see each compose YAML, plus the [TPS chart for the full lineup](../README.md#measured-tps-at-a-glance) in the top-level README.

| Compose | Max ctx | Narr / Code TPS | TTFT | Concurrency | Vision | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dual.yml` | 262K | 69 / 89 | ~145 ms | 2 | ✅ | general default |
| `dual-turbo.yml` | 262K | 58 / 76 per stream (269 agg @ 4) | ~110 ms | 4 | ✅ | multi-tenant |
| `dual-dflash.yml` | 185K | 82 / 125 | ~140 ms | 1 | ✅ | code + vision |
| `dual-dflash-noviz.yml` | 200K | 78 / 127 | ~145 ms | 1 | ❌ | pure text code |

All four dual variants re-benched 2026-05-01 PM on the v0.20 + Genesis v7.65 dev tip substrate (n=5 measured + 3 warmup per prompt; v7.69 re-bench pending — decode TPS regime unchanged by the bump, which targets Cliff 2 prefill envelope on single-card):

| Variant | Narr / Code wall_TPS (CV) | vs prior chart |
|---|---|---|
| `dual.yml` | 68.61 / 90.71 (CV 1.8% both) | flat (within noise) |
| `dual-turbo.yml` | 58.33 / 76.01 (n=1) · 269 TPS aggregate at n=4 streams | matches prior |
| `dual-dflash.yml` | 77.12 / 125.97 (CV 2-4%) | code flat, narr -5.9% (slight) |
| `dual-dflash-noviz.yml` | 78.94 / 123.18 (CV 2-3%) | flat (within noise) |

Code TPS held within bench variance across all 4 variants — no v0.20 regression on fp8 / FP16 paths. Run-by-run + per-config summaries in [`results/v0.20-migration/`](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/tree/master/results/v0.20-migration).

## Models supported on dual 3090

- **[Qwen3.6-27B](../models/qwen3.6-27b/)** — primary model. Runs single-card AND dual-card. Quant choices (AutoRound INT4, GGUF Q3_K_XL / Q4_K_M), Genesis patch surface (mostly single-card relevant), engine internals all in the model directory.
- **[Gemma 4 31B](../models/gemma-4-31b/)** — dual-card only on Ampere 24 GB (single-card boot OOMs even at 8K ctx; needs 32 GB+ per card). Two drafter paths (MTP via Google's official `gemma-4-31B-it-assistant` + DFlash via z-lab) × two KV strategies (bf16 / 32K vs INT8 PTH / 262K) + AWQ-4bit-weights variant. Genesis doesn't apply (Genesis patches are Qwen3-Next-specific).

As more models land, they'll show up here with their dual-card compose set.

## Heads-up: multimodal & image/video models on dual cards

Two lessons that generalize beyond the LLM composes above (learned wiring up Qwen3-Omni + scoping image generation on 2× 3090):

- **Size the *full pipeline*, not the transformer.** Multimodal and diffusion models bundle a large **text encoder** (8–24 GB: T5-XXL, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-VL-8B, Mistral-3-24B). A small quantized transformer can still blow a 24 GB card once the encoder + VAE + activations load — so an image model generally **won't co-reside** with an LLM on one card. Give it a dedicated card or **time-share** (run it when the LLM isn't).
- **Reach full context with fp8/int8 KV on a single card before reaching for TP/PP.** On PCIe-no-NVLink, tensor/pipeline parallelism pays a per-layer cross-card cost; halving the KV (fp8 / int8) often gets a model to its **full native context on *one* card** with zero cross-card traffic — strictly better here. (Qwen3-Omni's thinker reached its full 65 K single-card via fp8 KV — no TP/PP needed.)
- **Image/video generation → use ComfyUI on a freed card**, not the LLM stack. Sized model shortlist + the Open WebUI → ComfyUI UI pattern: [FAQ.md → Image & video generation](FAQ.md#image--video-generation).
