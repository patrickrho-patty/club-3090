# test-soak-decode-source — decode-figure provenance + engine counters.
#
# Covers the pair #1267 (an unmeasurable turn and a genuine silent-empty turn
# rendered IDENTICALLY) and #1268 (the 100 ms client-timing floor discards real
# decode on fast hardware). Both are failures you cannot see in the output,
# which is what these assertions are shaped around: they check that two
# different states RENDER differently, not merely that a run completes.
#
# Pre-fix, both states printed a bare `decode_tps=0.0` and the reader had to
# redo `wall - ttft` by hand to tell "fine, decoded in 49 ms" from "HTTP 200
# with zero tokens — the failure soak exists to catch". Three real turns from a
# PASSING 25-turn run on the reference rig:
#     wall=656ms    ttft=557ms    -> decode window  99 ms
#     wall=650ms    ttft=550ms    -> decode window 100 ms
#     wall=10606ms  ttft=10531ms  -> decode window  75 ms
#
# Contract asserted here:
#   1. unmeasurable renders as `decode_tps=n/a` + its window width, and is
#      textually DISTINGUISHABLE from a silent-empty turn's `decode_tps=0.0`
#   2. the run summary states the basis split, so p50's denominator is explicit,
#      and the silent-empty discriminator is unchanged (it keys on
#      completion_tokens, never on decode_tps)
#   3. an engine counter, when reachable, produces the figure INSTEAD of the
#      SSE-timed window — on a turn whose window is under the floor, which
#      pre-fix reported as 0.0. Three sources: /metrics TPOT histogram,
#      SGLang's "gen throughput (token/s)" log line, llama.cpp's "eval time"
#   4. llama.cpp's PROMPT eval line (prefill) is never read as the decode rate
#   5. the scrape is bounded to the turn (`--since`) and reads STDERR
#   6. SOAK_ENGINE_COUNTER=off restores pure client-side timing + the floor —
#      the one-word reversal of the #1268 design decision
#
# Negative control (how this test was proven to bite): run it against the
# pre-fix tree — `git stash` / `git checkout <base> -- scripts/soak-*` — and
# leg 1 fails on the first assertion, because there `decode_tps=0.0` is all
# there is. Every engine leg fails there too: no counter is ever read.
