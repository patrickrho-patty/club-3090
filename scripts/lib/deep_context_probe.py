# `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` is gated on a SERVER flag on both
# engines, and the gate is identical for streaming and non-streaming:
#   SGLang v0.5.19  --enable-cache-report   (usage_processor.py:40/80). Even with
#                   the flag the field is OMITTED when the count is 0. 0 of the 15
#                   shipped sglang composes pass it.
#   vLLM   v0.29.0  --enable-prompt-tokens-details (launchers/cli_args.py:132,
#                   default False). 20 shipped vllm composes pass it.
# So an ABSENT field is ambiguous — "0 cached" or "not reported" — and reading it
# as 0 is exactly the false-clean this probe exists to avoid. On this rig a
# 4,212-token prompt repeated came back TTFT 3.15s -> 0.10s, `#cached-token: 4160`
# in the engine log, and `prompt_tokens_details: null` in BOTH stream modes.
#
# Fallback: both engines publish a Prometheus counter whose DELTA across one
# request is the tokens served from prefix cache. It is engine-wide (concurrent
# traffic counts too), so the column is labelled with its source:
#   SGLang  sglang:realtime_tokens_total{mode="prefill_cache"}  needs --enable-metrics (13/15 composes). Measured.
#   vLLM    vllm:prefix_cache_hits_total   v1/metrics/loggers.py:596 — source-verified, NOT live-tested here.
# A reuse self-test right after calibration (same prompt twice) decides which
# source is live. When neither is, the column renders n/a and names the flag.
