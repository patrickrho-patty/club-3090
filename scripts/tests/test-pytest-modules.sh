#
# Guard: the pytest modules under scripts/tests/ actually RUN.
#
# Why (club-3090#1316): the documented gate is `for t in scripts/tests/*.sh`, so
# the four `test_*.py` modules beside those gates were invoked by NOTHING — not
# this suite, not CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml` only regenerates the
# CHANGELOG on tag push). #1205 hard-cut the `local/` namespace and carefully
# updated every `.sh` test it touched; the `.py` ones it could not know to
# update, because no gate would ever have told it. Three of the four modules
# went red and stayed red for a week under a green 172/0 sweep.
#
# A test nothing invokes cannot fail, and therefore protects nothing — it is
# indistinguishable from a deleted test except that it still LOOKS like
# coverage. This wrapper is the one entry point that makes them fail out loud.
#
# ⚠️ Naming contract this relies on:
#     test-<name>.sh   a bash gate     (run directly by the suite loop)
#     test_<name>.py   a pytest module (run HERE, never standalone)
#     anything else    a helper, NOT a test
# `lib-scan-bare-grep.py` is the third kind — a scanner library consumed by
# test-no-bare-grep.sh. Globbing `*.py` would try to execute it and produce a
# spurious failure, which is how #1316 was first mis-scored. Glob `test_*.py`.
#
# ⚠️ These modules MUST be run via `python3 -m pytest` from the repo root, not
# as `python3 scripts/tests/test_promote.py` — run standalone they die with
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts'`, a harness-shaped error that
# invites shrugging past a real failure.
#
# ⚠️ A missing pytest is a HARD FAIL here, deliberately — not a skip. Skipping
# would reproduce the exact defect this guard exists to close: a gate that is
# green because it did nothing.
