# test-report-exit-code — inner verdicts must reach report.sh's exit (#813).
#
# Committed to on #619: `report.sh --full` exited 0 while verify-stress printed
# "1 stress check(s) failed" inside. A --full chain whose exit code doesn't
# reflect inner verdicts is unsafe to automate against, which is the entire
# point of --full. It was caught only because @seanyourhighness read the inner
# verdicts, which most reporters reasonably won't.
#
# Contract asserted here:
#   0  every stage that ran passed, or no stage was requested
#   2  ADVISORY-only — the agent-safety VRAM margin at the context ceiling.
#      Recall is CORRECT there; what fails is headroom for sustained agent
#      load. Distinguishable so a caller can gate on hard failures alone.
#   1  hard failure — a correctness check failed, or a stage could not run
#   ...and a per-check summary names the failing check, so it is identifiable
#      from the exit path without reading every inner block.

# Force Python's UTF-8 mode (PEP 540) for every python3 this script runs.
# Repo sources are full of unicode (— × → ⚠), and without this a rig on a real
# non-UTF-8 locale (de_DE.iso88591 and friends) decodes reads, stdout AND argv
# with the locale codec, which crashes the launcher/emit paths (#779). Python
# already auto-enables UTF-8 mode for the C/POSIX locale, so this covers the
# case it does NOT: a genuine non-UTF-8, non-C locale. Exported, so child
# processes and nested scripts inherit it. Guarded by test-locale-utf8.sh.
