# club-containers.sh — THE single source of truth for "is this container ours?"
#
# Companion to engine-kind.sh. That file answers *which engine family* a
# container belongs to; this one answers *which containers exist at all*. They
# are different questions and were failing in different places.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# --------------------
# "Find the running inference container" was re-implemented per script as a
# hardcoded name-prefix list, and every new engine silently fell out of every
# copy. This is the SAME defect that #281 fixed in switch.sh — its teardown used
# a fixed `^(vllm-|llama-cpp-)` regex, missed beellama-/ik-llama-/sglang-
# containers and leaked their VRAM across switches — and it was fixed there by
# deriving the set from the registry (VARIANT_CONTAINER). The other copies were
# never converted:
#
#   report.sh  --filter 'name=vllm-' 'name=llama-cpp-' 'name=beellama-'
#              'name=club3090-' 'name=ik-llama-'      → no sglang-, no exl3
#   health.sh  ^(vllm-|llama-cpp-|ik-llama-|sglang-|beellama-)
#                                                     → no exl3
#
# So on a rig serving exl3, `report.sh` and `health.sh` reported "no engine
# container running" over a perfectly healthy server — silently, because "none
# found" is indistinguishable from "none there".
#
# ⭐ REGISTRY-DERIVED, so a new engine is covered the moment its slug lands. No
# list to update, and no way to forget one.
#
# Degrades OPEN: if the registry cannot be read (no python3, broken checkout) it
# falls back to the union of the legacy prefixes, so callers are never WORSE off
# than the hardcoded version they replaced.

# ⚠️ PICK THE RIGHT FORM. club_container_re anchors registry names at BOTH ends;
# club_container_re_loose anchors only at the start. A caller that greps a
# COMPOSITE line — `{{.Names}}|{{.Ports}}`, `{{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}…` — must use
# _loose, because a `$`-anchored name can never match there. Getting this wrong is
# silent: the exact arms simply never fire and the matcher quietly degrades to the
# legacy prefix list, i.e. back to the bug. preflight.sh shipped that way for one
# commit. Audit with: for each call site, look at the `docker ps --format` feeding it.
#
# COST: club_container_names shells out to registry-emit.sh --json (~2.5 s cold)
# because the container name is NOT in registry.yaml — it is derived per slug from
# the compose `container_name:`. Cached for the process, and every caller reaches it
# only after cheaper checks have already found something serving, so no launch pays
# it on the empty-rig path.
#
# Repo convention (#779): UTF-8 mode before any python3, so a rig on a real
# non-UTF-8 locale cannot mangle reads/stdout/argv. Defaulted, not forced, so a
# user who deliberately sets PYTHONUTF8=0 keeps control. Guarded by
# test-locale-utf8.sh.
