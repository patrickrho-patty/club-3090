# test-soak-vram-baseline — the warm-VRAM-baseline anchoring contract (#829).
#
# soak-test.sh used to capture its baseline unconditionally at the END of
# session 1. When the engine died mid-session-1 that sampled a corpse, and every
# later reading then read as multi-GB growth: #827 printed
#     - VRAM grew 32053 MiB > 200 MiB threshold.
#     - VRAM session-to-session oscillation reached 63866 MiB.
# on a run whose only real fault was an unrelated engine crash. That is the
# loudest FAIL in the report and it points triage at a memory leak that does not
# exist.
#
# Contract asserted here:
#   1. an errored session NEVER anchors the baseline
#   2. a later CLEAN session re-anchors it, and pre-anchor rows are excluded
#      from growth + oscillation
#   3. if NO session runs clean, VRAM growth/oscillation are UNMEASURABLE —
#      never a number — and the verdict is not PASS
#   4. an all-clean run is byte-identical to the pre-fix behaviour

# with the locale codec, which crashes the launcher/emit paths (#779). Python
# already auto-enables UTF-8 mode for the C/POSIX locale, so this covers the
