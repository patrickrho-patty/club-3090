# Guard: no EXECUTED `grep` in scripts/ may be the bare builtin name.
#
# Why (club-3090#1280): `grep` is shimmed to ugrep in interactive shells on some
# rigs, which breaks exact output matching. A gate for this already existed —
# test-bench-capture.sh asserts it for `lib/capture.sh` — but it covered ONE
# file, so 119 executed bare greps sat unguarded across 27 others. The risk
# concentrates in sourced files: `preflight.sh` alone held 24 and is sourced by
# 20 scripts, and a sourced file runs inside the caller's shell, which is
# exactly where the shim reaches.
#
# ⚠️ Must FAIL against the pre-fix tree, or it is asserting the wrong thing.
#
# ⚠️ Scope: EXECUTED greps only. A `grep` inside an echo/printf string is advice
# we print for a user to type; rewriting it would be wrong, and 11 such lines
# exist deliberately. Hence the scanner is quote-aware rather than a regex — a
# naive `grep -E '\| *grep '` flags those 11 and a maintainer learns to ignore
# the gate. It also treats `$( ... )` INSIDE double quotes as code again, which
# a naive scanner misses; that case accounted for 17 of the 119.
#
# scripts/tests/ is out of scope: it asserts ON grep output.
