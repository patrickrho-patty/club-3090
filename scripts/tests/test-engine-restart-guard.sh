#
# The bug it locks down (club-3090 discussion #1076, reported by foureight84):
# a fatal EngineCore error killed the engine mid-run, Docker's restart policy
# brought the container back, and the harness retried the in-flight scenarios
# against a dead/booting engine. The run COMPLETED AND REPORTED A PLAUSIBLE
# SCORE — three --full runs were published at 129 / 128 / 127 before anyone
# noticed. RestartCount is the only signal that separates "the model got these
# wrong" from "the engine was not running".
#
# Validates:
#   1.  POSITIVE CONTROL: RestartCount rising ⇒ rc=1 and a loud message. A gate
#       that cannot detect the bug it was written for is theatre — this case is
#       the reason the file exists, so it is asserted first.
#   2.  NEGATIVE CONTROL: RestartCount flat ⇒ rc=0, silent. A guard that fires on
#       healthy runs would be turned off within a week.
#   3.  CONTAINER=none (bare-metal endpoint) ⇒ rc=2 AND says so. Unavailable must
#       NOT read as clean, or the guard becomes the false-clean it prevents.
#   4.  docker absent ⇒ rc=2 and says so.
#   5.  RestartCount unreadable (container removed mid-run) ⇒ rc=2, NOT rc=0.
#   6.  CLUB3090_ALLOW_ENGINE_RESTART=1 ⇒ rc=0 despite a rise (documented escape).
#   7.  A multi-restart rise reports the correct delta.
#
# Harness: mock `docker` on PATH, env-driven RestartCount. Fully offline.
