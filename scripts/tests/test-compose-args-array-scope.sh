# Every "${X_ARGS[@]}" used on an `exec` line must be ASSIGNED at a block depth no
# deeper than that exec -- i.e. not inside a branch the exec's own path may skip.
#
# WHY: a compose entrypoint that ends in `if ...; then exec A; else exec B; fi` will
# happily accept an array assigned inside ONE branch. The other branch expands an
# unset array to nothing and the feature is SILENTLY DEAD on that path, while
# `docker compose config`, `bash -n` and every other gate stay green -- the script
# is perfectly valid bash.
#
# Caught for real: porting #1170's MAMBA_BLOCK_SIZE knob to the fp8 composes put
# MAMBA_ARGS=() inside the `_NVLINK_ENABLED=1` then-branch. The else-branch is the
# no-NVLink path -- most rigs, including this one -- so the knob would have shipped
# dead exactly where it was most likely to be used.
#
# ⚠️ Indentation is NOT a sufficient proxy: in these composes the branch execs sit
# at the same column as a block nudged inside the branch. Depth is tracked from the
# shell keywords instead.
