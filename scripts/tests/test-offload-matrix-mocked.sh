# Drives the REAL sweep end-to-end against a fake llama-server and a fake nvidia-smi,
# so every status-classification and row-integrity path is exercised deterministically
# with no GPU and no model. This is where the sweep's actual logic gets asserted: the
# defects it has already shipped were all "plausible wrong row", never a crash.
#
# HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION — both of these are load-bearing, not conveniences:
#   INHERIT=0                  the sweep unconditionally runs `pgrep -x llama-server`
#                              and, if one is up, inherits -m/-ot/-t/-ub/-ct from its
#                              argv. Without this a stray production server silently
#                              rewrites the config under test.
#   ALLOW_CONCURRENT_SERVER=1  the same detection makes the sweep refuse to start
#                              (exit 2) while a server runs. Mocked arms allocate no
#                              VRAM, so there is genuinely nothing to contend for.
#
# Asserts STRUCTURE and STATUS only — never a throughput value. Numbers from a fake
# server mean nothing, and real numbers are not portable across rigs.
