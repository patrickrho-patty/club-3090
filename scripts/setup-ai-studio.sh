# One-command setup for the club-3090 AI STUDIO — a self-hosted, open-weight
# image / video / audio studio behind Open WebUI. Builds + downloads + brings the
# stack up + installs the OWUI pipe, so a fresh clone goes straight to generating.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/setup-ai-studio.sh           # build + download (~120 GB) + up + install pipe (asks to confirm)
#   bash scripts/setup-ai-studio.sh --yes     # skip the confirmation prompt
#
# Env knobs:
#   SKIP_BUILD=1     skip the ComfyUI image build (already built)
#   SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1  skip the ~120 GB roster pull (already on disk)
#   SKIP_DISK_CHECK=1 bypass the free-space preflight (resume an idempotent download)
#   SKIP_PIPE=1      skip installing the OWUI Studio pipe (do it later)
#   ASSUME_YES=1     same as --yes (also auto-yes when not a TTY / under CI)
#   LANIP=<ip>       host IP shown in the final URLs. Auto-detected + saved to .env on first run;
#                    pin it in .env (or via this env var) if it picks the wrong NIC / can't detect.
#   MODEL_DIR=<dir>  HF/GGUF cache root; the ComfyUI tree goes to a "comfyui" sibling
#                    of it (override COMFYUI_ROOT / COMFYUI_MODELS_DIR to decouple).
#
# Idempotent: re-running rebuilds/re-pulls only what changed, installs-or-updates
# the pipe, then brings the stack up via `gpu-mode ai-studio`.
