# test-report-power-state — a shared report must say what power envelope it was
# taken under, and must never let "power was not read" look like "power is fine".
#
# Why this test exists. A run on this stack measured ~40% below its own recorded
# baseline with a signature that read as an upstream speculative-decoding
# regression: spec_n=1 and spec_n=2 produced identical throughput while draft
# acceptance stayed healthy. An upstream bug report was nearly filed. The cause
# was a persistent 230 W cap against 370/420 W factory defaults, applied at boot
# by a systemd unit, and found only by manually reading `power.limit`.
#
# report.sh has emitted a per-GPU wattage since its first commit, so "is the
# number present" was never the gap. The gap was interpretability:
#   1. a cap was a soft parenthetical nested two levels into a mid-report
#      section, in a paste that gets truncated from the bottom;
#   2. it was stated in absolute watts, and whoever triages someone else's rig
#      does not know that card's stock TDP, so "limit=230.00 W" reads as normal;
#   3. when nvidia-smi was installed but its query FAILED, the GPU section
#      rendered as a heading with nothing under it — so the absence of a cap
#      warning was indistinguishable from a cap nobody ever looked for.
#
# Contract asserted here:
#   - a cap below default surfaces UP FRONT, per GPU, as watts-of-watts AND a
#     percentage of that card's own default;
#   - an uncapped rig emits no cap warning anywhere (the negative control — a
#     banner that always fired would assert nothing);
#   - enforced.power.limit is surfaced when, and only when, it undercuts the
#     set limit;
#   - a present-but-unreadable query says "NOT READ" explicitly;
#   - a machine with no nvidia-smi at all still produces a report.
