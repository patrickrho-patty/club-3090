# catalog.sh — register / unregister models in YOUR local catalog layer (#1202 P4).
#
# The local layer had an executor (promote.py / demote.py) but no front door:
# both live under scripts/lib/, which reads as internal, and registering meant
# hand-authoring a spec JSON. Meanwhile the compose->spec derivation lived only
# inside the cockpit, so the layer was write-only from the UI (#1153). This is
# the CLI half; c3 and this script now share one derivation.
