# emit a parseable tool call — it should synthesize one, inject the fixture
# tool_result, count the miss, and reach the configured TURNS. This test stands
# up a mock SSE endpoint and asserts both the miss path (ramp continues) and the
# success path (normal tool-call flow still works), fully offline (no GPU).

# divide bench.sh shed in #854 — eleven turns reading 409,726 → 1,808,323 TPS.
# The canvas leg below reproduces that shape against the old code and asserts the
# fix; the additivity leg asserts an autoregressive ramp is untouched.
