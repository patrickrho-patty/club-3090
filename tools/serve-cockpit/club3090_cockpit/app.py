"""club3090 serve cockpit — main Textual application.

The three modes (Run · Operate · Validate) are wired to the real data layer
(``services.CockpitData`` + ``data.py`` shapes), reusing the shared core
(``club3090_tui_core``) for detect / streaming / widgets.  (R1 folded the former
Discover + Serve + Benchmarks modes into a single Run mode; R2a renamed the
Estate mode to Operate and moved the Doctor surface into it.)

  - Run / Catalog        : real enriched rows from ``CockpitData.load_catalog``;
                          ``e`` opens ``explain`` (incl. the folded-in cross-rig
                          benchmark rows), ``/`` filters, ``⏎`` builds the GATED
                          ``serve(slug)`` plan and opens the reconcile-gated
                          ConfirmActionScreen — on confirm the boot streams into
                          the transient Run LivePane (#serve-live).
  - Run / BYO            : ``CockpitData.byo_check`` → fit verdict + swap_path.
  - Operate / Orch       : ``estate_state`` live (GPU cards, Doctor, scenes,
                          services, power-cap); scene-switch → confirm modal that
                          FIRST calls ``reconcile_before_write`` then ``scene_switch``;
                          ``c`` cap on/off, ``w`` cap sweep, ``p`` prune (all gated).
  - Operate / Containers : ``containers`` real list; drill into Logs/Top/Config;
                          restart/stop/rm behind the reconcile-gated confirm.
  - Operate / Doctor     : real cards from ``doctor()`` (health + diagnose-estate
                          + diagnose-profile) — live-state, READ-only.
  - Validate / Run       : launchable ladder + extra tools (``run_validation``,
                          confirm-gated, streamed into a LivePane) + §3.5 *tune*
                          gotchas inline.
  - Validate / Evidence  : ``evidence_list()`` run tags; ``⏎`` opens the
                          ``evidence_report()`` modal; ``s`` stages the gated
                          submit-to-localmaxxing (outward NETWORK write, never auto).

EVERY GPU-claiming write (serve / scene-switch / estate-down / container
restart|stop|rm) goes through ``CockpitData.execute_action``, which re-runs the
reconcile gate first and refuses when unsafe (unless an explicit, reasoned force
override).  Heavy/destructive non-GPU writes (validation launches, submit-bench
POST, power-cap, prune) are confirm-gated too.  The write runner / network are
NEVER executed live — tests inject fakes and conftest blocks the real spawn.

    """#5 — a Footer whose key items participate in the Tab focus chain.

    Textual's stock ``Footer`` is ``can_focus_children=False`` and its
    ``FooterKey`` items are mouse-only (``on_mouse_down`` → ``simulate_key``), so
    a keyboard user can never Tab onto a footer affordance.  This subclass:

      1. opts into ``can_focus_children=True`` so the focus chain can include the
         footer's children, and
      2. marks each ``FooterKey`` ``can_focus=True`` as it is composed, and
      3. activates the focused key on Enter (``simulate_key``) — the keyboard
         analogue of the existing mouse-down activation.

    This does NOT change the existing Tab behaviour for tables / inputs / the
    sub-tab cycle — it only ADDS the footer keys to the END of the focus chain
    (Textual orders the chain by DOM position, and the Footer is docked last).
    Pressing the highlighted footer key's binding still routes through the app's
    normal action dispatch (so gating is unchanged).

    Recompose guard: the stock Footer recomposes on EVERY ``bindings_changed``
    signal — and moving focus ONTO a footer key re-fires that signal (the focused
    widget changed), which rebuilds the FooterKey objects and strands the focus
    we just placed (focus → DataTable → signal → recompose → … a churn loop).  We
    suppress the recompose when the DISPLAYED binding signature (the ordered
