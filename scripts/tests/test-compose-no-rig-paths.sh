#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-compose-no-rig-paths.sh — no compose may use a MAINTAINER-RIG absolute path
# as an environment DEFAULT. The repo ships to strangers; a default is what runs
# when they set nothing, so a default of `/mnt/models/huggingface` silently points
# their container at a directory only the reference rig has.
#
# Why a guard and not a convention: the convention already existed and was followed
# by most composes (the repo-relative `${MODEL_DIR:-../../../../../../models-cache}`
# is the documented shape), yet three shipped composes had drifted onto rig paths
# and a fourth was added on 2026-08-11 before this guard existed. Conventions that
# only live in reviewers' heads decay; this is the same reasoning as
# test-compose-bind-host.sh.
#
# What is CHECKED — three surfaces:
#   (a) `${VAR:-<rig-path>}` environment defaults.
#   (b) bare rig paths on the host side of a volume/command list entry.
#   (c) rig paths ANYWHERE a container actually runs or PRINTS — i.e. inside an
#       `entrypoint:` or `command:` block, comments excluded.
#
# Surface (c) was added 2026-09-12 for #1271. 18 GLM composes printed
#     echo "[spec]   - download it: /opt/ai/hf-download.sh …"
# as the remediation for a missing DFlash2 drafter — a hardened wrapper that lives
# only on the maintainer's rig and is NOT in this repo. Every user but one was
# handed a script they cannot run, in the one place they are guaranteed to be
# reading: having just been refused a boot. The gate was GREEN throughout, because
# a rig path inside an entrypoint `echo` is neither an env default (a) nor a bare
# host-side list entry (b). The blind spot was the checked surface, not the intent
# — the header above already claimed this class. So: remediation text a user is
# told to TYPE is a value the compose USES, and is checked.
#
# What is NOT checked: comments and prose. Documenting the reference rig
# ("measured on /mnt/models/...", "Ledger: /opt/ai/moecache-releases.md") is
# legitimate and stays legal, inside an entrypoint block as well as outside it —
# the failure mode this guards is a value the compose would actually USE or SHOW.
#
# CONTAINER-side absolutes are legal and must never trip this: `/models/...`,
# `/etc/club3090/...`, `/app/llama-server`, `/dev/shm` are all correct inside the
# container. That allowance is structural, not a deny-list exception — RIG_PREFIXES
# only matches absolutes a stranger cannot have, and none of those match it. The
# prefix set is deliberately NOT widened: an over-wide docs gate once produced
# ~200 false positives, so breadth here is bought only with evidence.
#
# If a compose genuinely needs an operator-supplied absolute path, give it a knob
# with a portable default (repo-relative, or another variable), never a rig path.
# If it needs to tell a user how to fetch something, point at an IN-REPO command
# (`bash scripts/setup.sh <model>`), never at a script on the maintainer's rig.
