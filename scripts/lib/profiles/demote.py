"""Local-layer REMOVAL — unregister a model that ``promote.py`` wrote.

``promote.py`` writes three things for a local model and says, in its own
docstring, that the rollback is "delete the file(s)". That instruction is the
whole reason this script exists: doing it by hand means deleting

  1. ``scripts/lib/profiles-local/models.d/<model_id>.yml``
  2. ``scripts/lib/profiles-local/composes/<model_id>/…``
  3. the slug's entry in ``scripts/lib/profiles-local/registry.local.json``

and **missing (3) is the failure that bites**: the files are gone but the merged
registry still advertises the slug, so every launcher offers a config whose
compose no longer exists. Removing (3) alone is just as bad in the other
direction — an orphaned compose tree nothing references.

    python3 scripts/lib/profiles/demote.py --slug local/my-model
    python3 scripts/lib/profiles/demote.py --slug local/my-model --dry-run

CORE IS NEVER TOUCHED. There is no ``--layer core``: a curated entry lives in
git-tracked files and version control is its removal tool. Asking to remove a
non-``local/`` slug is refused before anything is read.

Exit codes match promote.py: 0 success, 3 refusal (nothing written), 2 internal
failure after removal started.

Success marker (the c3 parser hook)::

    DEMOTE_OK <slug>
