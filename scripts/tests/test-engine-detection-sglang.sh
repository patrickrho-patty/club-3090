# Guard: an `sglang-*` container must resolve to ENGINE_KIND=sglang everywhere.
#
# Why this exists (club-3090#1261, @paulp83): a hand-rolled SGLang NVFP4 run
# printed `engine=unknown`, so verify-full's acceptance check fell through the
# `case "$ENGINE_KIND"` dispatch into the vLLM branch, found no "SpecDecoding
# metrics" line, and SKIPPED. The DFlash2 drafter was never verified alive —
# which is exactly the sglang#39087 false-clean (a garbage-drafting drafter
# leaves output correct and only collapses decode, silently).
#
# The cause was NOT the acceptance check added in #1249. It was detection:
# every container-name fallback listed `vllm-*` and `llama-cpp-*` and simply
# had no `sglang-*` arm, even though rebench-full.sh and club3090-env.sh both
# already use that prefix. So the #1249 SGLang branch was unreachable by
# auto-detection and had likely never fired.
#
# ⚠️ This test must FAIL against the pre-fix tree. If it passes before the fix,
# it is asserting the wrong thing.
