"""Render the LiteLLM config the gateway ACTUALLY serves, from what is running.

See scripts/lib/litellm-sync.sh for the full rationale. In short:

  config.yaml          tracked CATALOG view — one canonical slug per model,
                       port-pinned, registry-derived. Right for a file in git.
  config.runtime.yaml  gitignored RUNTIME view — what the container mounts,
                       rendered from endpoints that actually answered.

The catalog view cannot be what a gateway serves: its route for a model names
ONE slug's default_port, so running a sibling slug for that model advertises a
model on a port with nothing behind it, and 13 of 22 models have no route at all.
Both failures are silent — the model list looks populated either way.

# /model_group/info publishes (pi-setup.sh would turn thinking off). So a route on
