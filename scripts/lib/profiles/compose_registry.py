"""Loader + API surface for the compose registry (DATA lives in registry.yaml).

The curated catalog is data, not code: the ~100 slug entries and the policy
maps (defaults / engine preference / recommended models) live in

single import surface — consumers keep importing COMPOSE_REGISTRY, DEFAULTS,

load_local_registry() exactly as they always did.

The registry intentionally mirrors the shipped compose files. It is not a
generator and it does not attempt to normalize away historical variants.

#
# RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS and ENGINE_PREFERENCE are DATA now — they live in
# scripts/lib/profiles/registry.yaml (`recommended_default_models` /
# `engine_preference`) and are wired to the module names above. Maintainer
# knobs, edited by PR, never auto-grown; see docs/model-default-resolver
# design + the repo AGENTS.md "Default rule" note. History that used to sit on
# these literals: qwen3.6-27b left the recommended list 2026-08-12 (all its
# llama.cpp/ik single-card slugs deprecated → its curated default degraded to
# vllm/minimal); `beellama` left every ENGINE_PREFERENCE walk 2026-07-27
# (engine retired) and `ik-llama` followed 2026-08-12 (no functional slug).
#
# DEFAULTS is flattened back from the YAML's nested {model: {engine:
# {topology: slug}}} map at import; tuple-key lookups work exactly as before.
