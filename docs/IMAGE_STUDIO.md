# Image Studio — local image generation + chat

A self-hosted bundle that gives you **text-to-image generation and an LLM chat in one
browser UI**, both running locally on your own GPUs:

- **[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI)** runs **Ideogram-4** (fp8) for image generation.
- **[Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)** is the front-end — chat plus a 🖼️ image button that calls ComfyUI.
- **gemma-4-12b** (llama.cpp) is the default chat model, sized to **coexist** with image gen on a second GPU.

On a 2-GPU box the two run at once (image gen on GPU 0, chat on GPU 1). On a single GPU
they're mutually exclusive (see [Single-GPU](#single-gpu)).

---

## Quickstart

```bash
bash scripts/setup-image-studio.sh
```

That builds the ComfyUI image, downloads the Ideogram-4 model set (~27 GB), and brings the
stack up via `gpu-mode image-studio`. Then open:

- **Open WebUI** → `http://<your-host>:8080` — start here (chat + 🖼️ image button)
- **ComfyUI** → `http://<your-host>:8188` — full node-graph control

> First image after a cold ComfyUI takes ~2 min (it loads ~20 GB of weights). Warm
> generations are ~70 s at 1024².

Skip flags: `SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1` (weights already present), `SKIP_BUILD=1` (image already built).

## Two front-ends — which to use

| Want… | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Easy** — type a prompt, get an image, chat | **Open WebUI** (`:8080`) | One box + the 🖼️ button. Your daily driver. |
| **Control** — steps, CFG, seed, structured prompts, img2img | **ComfyUI** (`:8188`) | The node graph. Drop in when you want to tune. |

In Open WebUI, image generation rides on the chat: send a prompt, then click the **🖼️
picture icon** on the assistant's reply to render it via Ideogram-4. (It won't appear in
the model selector — that's only for chat models.)

In ComfyUI, load the bundled **Ideogram 4** template (Workflow → Browse Templates → Image).
All model files are already in place, so it loads with no missing nodes.

## Modes (`gpu-mode`)

Image gen, video gen, and chat are **GPU-mutually-exclusive** at the heavy end (a video
model wants both cards; image + a small chat model fit on one card each). So the switcher
is a resource-mode manager:

| Mode | What it runs | GPUs |
|---|---|---|
| `gpu-mode image-studio` | ComfyUI/Ideogram-4 + gemma-4-12b chat + Open WebUI | GPU 0 (image) + GPU 1 (chat) |
| `gpu-mode comfyui` | ComfyUI only (all GPUs) — for video / large image jobs | all |
| `gpu-mode chat` | Open WebUI + LiteLLM (no local GPU model) | none |

Within ComfyUI, switch *what* you generate by loading a different workflow/template.

## VRAM by resolution (Ideogram-4 fp8, measured on one RTX 3090)

| Resolution | Peak VRAM | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1024×1024 | ~18.5 GB | ~70 s warm | comfortable on a 24 GB card |
| 2048×2048 | ~21.8 GB (89%) | ~320 s | fits but tight — **batch size 1 only**; larger or batched → OOM |

It runs **single-device** — a second GPU doesn't speed up one generation. For routine
high-res, prefer **generate at 1024² then upscale** (higher quality and lower peak VRAM
than native 2048²).

---

## Chat model

Default is **gemma-4-12b** on the spare GPU (`:8069`), so chat and image gen run at the
same time. To use your full LLM catalog instead, point Open WebUI at LiteLLM — see the
commented `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` block in `services/openwebui/docker-compose.yml`. (LiteLLM's
larger models are GPU-mutex with ComfyUI, so you'd lose simultaneous image gen.)

### Single-GPU

With one GPU, image gen and a local chat model can't run together. `gpu-mode image-studio`
detects this and starts ComfyUI only; for chat use `gpu-mode chat` (LiteLLM) or run a local
model while ComfyUI is down.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Image button missing / image gen not configured in Open WebUI.** Open WebUI's image
settings are *PersistentConfig* — the values in `services/openwebui/imagegen.env` apply only
on a **fresh data volume** (first boot). If you reused an existing `open-webui-data` volume,
set it manually: **Admin → Settings → Images** → Engine `ComfyUI`, Base URL
`http://host.docker.internal:8188`, then load the Ideogram-4 workflow (or recreate the volume).

**Out of memory at high resolution.** Drop back to 1024² (+ upscale), and keep batch size 1
at 2048². Ideogram-4 fp8 peaks ~21.8 GB at 2048² — there's little headroom on a 24 GB card.

**First generation is very slow.** Cold ComfyUI loads ~20 GB (two fp8 transformers + the
text encoder). The first request after boot warms it; subsequent ones are ~70 s.

**First ComfyUI boot takes minutes.** The entrypoint clones ComfyUI + custom nodes and
installs requirements on first run. Tail it: `sudo docker logs -f comfyui`.

## What's installed

- Image model: Ideogram-4 fp8 (`services/comfyui/download_ideogram4.sh`) — two transformers
  + Qwen3-VL-8B text encoder + flux2 VAE, in the ComfyUI models tree.
- ComfyUI HEAD (native Ideogram-4 support) built via `services/comfyui/Dockerfile`.
- Open WebUI pinned to a tested release, image-gen wired via `services/openwebui/imagegen.env`.
- Chat: `models/gemma-4-12b/llama-cpp/compose/single/unsloth-q8kxl/base.yml` on the spare GPU.

> **Video & audio generation** are planned follow-ons (this page will gain `video-studio` /
> `audio-studio` sections as they land).
