THREE reasons incubating not production: (1) runs LMCache's third-party image (lmcache/vllm-openai, DIGEST-pinned — the tag is MUTABLE, and it bundles a newer vLLM 0.23.1-dev than our v0.22.0 pin; ✅-promotion wants LMCache on our own image), (2) L2 disk tier is unbounded (no size cap — disk-fill is on the operator; preflight soft-warns), (3) 38 GB image pulled on-demand. RAM-gated: preflight rejects --l1-size-gb over-allocation (the l1=100→reboot incident); needs ~58 GB free at l1=30, cap ~50 GB on a 94 GB rig; shm_size must track l1. Best for many concurrent long sessions kept warm (cold→warm TTFT ~7-8x) — efschu's high-context multi-session use case. Standard duals (vllm/dual, vllm/qwen-27b-dual-max) stay LMCache-free.",

On Ampere it works but has NO edge (~20% slower than the AutoRound tier for the same model) — prefer AutoRound/fp8 there; this slug's value on sub-sm_90 cards is models/cases where NVFP4 is the only quant. ENVELOPE CORRECTED BY #849: that run used util 0.85 (reporter's own override; shipped default at his checkout was 0.92) with batched-tokens at the then-shipped 8192, and passing the full gate on that pairing showed the #847 derate had the right diagnosis but the wrong lever -- card 32,607 MiB, util 0.85 leaves 4,891 MiB physical headroom vs 0.92's 2,609 MiB, while the process holds 2,860 MiB ABOVE its own budget (un-profiled GDN activation peak, vllm#44209); the overshoot fits at 0.85 and not at 0.92, so util was binding and the batched cut was not. MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS restored 2048 -> 8192 (the desk-derived 2048 was costing prefill); util 0.85 kept. STILL WANTED: a second independent 32 GB pair, and a rebench once vllm#50021 is inherited. Mirrors vllm/qwen-27b-dual-max's shape (TP=2 + MTP n=3 + fp8/e4m3 KV + vision @262K) with NVFP4 weights instead of FP8: ~11 GB/card weights vs dual-max's 14.5 — bigger KV pool headroom on 32 GB cards.

Output quality is temp-governed not mem-governed: temp 0.6 coherent, the card's temp 1.0 is unstable on short prompts (degenerate loops) — overridable via TEMP. fp8 WEIGHTS rejected (break this quant-sensitive 3B: non-terminating empty output).

# --- PR-B: model-default resolver knobs (maintainer-owned, design §13.3) ----
#
# Two curated tables drive the `<model>/default` resolver. They are maintainer
# knobs — edited by PR, never auto-grown. See docs/model-default-resolver
# design + the repo CLAUDE.md "Default rule" note.

# A SHORT opt-in shortlist of models eligible to be the *bare-launch* default
# (`launch.sh` with no model + no pin → first INSTALLED model on this list →
# its `<model>/default`). This is NOT an exhaustive ranking of the catalog:
#   - Models absent from it are fully runnable by name (`--model X` /
#     `X/default`); they are simply never the auto-default.
#   - New models are NOT auto-added. Adding a model touches nothing here;
#     promote one explicitly only when desired.
#   - Order within the (short) list = the tiebreak for "first installed".
RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS = ["qwen3.6-27b", "gemma-4-31b"]

# Which engine wins, per detected topology, when resolving `<model>/default`
# with no user pin. The resolver walks this list in order and picks the FIRST
# engine that has a functional DEFAULTS[(model, engine, topology)] entry (i.e.
# whose status is NOT in the (NA) set). This is the whole recommendation
# policy expressed as data — reorder a row to change a recommendation, no code
# change, any topology.
#
# Engine identifiers are the slug-prefix form used in DEFAULTS keys:
#   vllm · ik-llama · llamacpp   (+ beellama, aspirational — see below).
# `beellama` is ranked but has ZERO registry entries today (blocked on an
# upstream Docker image — see docs/UPSTREAM.md). The resolver skips it
# naturally (no DEFAULTS hit) → no behavior change until it is onboarded, at
# which point it AUTO-PROMOTES to the single-GPU default with no resolver edit.
# beellama removed from every walk 2026-07-27: the engine is retired (all 10
# slugs deprecated — Anbeeld #98 won't-fix upstream DFlash VRAM regression;
# pin v0.3.2-preview unmaintained). Slugs stay launchable by name with --force.
# Re-add if the llama-cpp-mainline migration ever revives a beellama build.
