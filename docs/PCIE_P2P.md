# PCIe Topology & Enabling P2P (multi-GPU, no NVLink)

This is the home for **getting the most out of a PCIe-only multi-GPU rig** — understanding your topology, and (optionally) enabling GPU↔GPU peer-to-peer (P2P) over the PCIe bus when you don't have NVLink.

**You don't need any of this to run the stack.** The default dual/multi-card path is PCIe-only with P2P *off* (`NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1`, custom all-reduce disabled) — it's robust, needs no tuning, and works out of the box on any consumer rig. This doc is for two audiences: anyone who wants to **read their topology correctly** (why does `topo -m` say `PHB`?), and enthusiasts who want to **squeeze a workload-dependent few-to-~20% more** out of the PCIe bus via P2P. If you have an NVLink bridge, see [HARDWARE.md → NVLink](HARDWARE.md#nvlink) instead — that path auto-detects.

> **Example rig used throughout:** ASRock Rack **ROMED8-2T** (single-socket EPYC SP3) + 2× RTX 3090. It's just a concrete illustration (one maintainer's box) — the principles are board-agnostic; substitute your own slot/BIOS specifics.

## The three layers of "is P2P on?" — read this first

"P2P" is three independent questions stacked on top of each other, and every confused triage in our tracker came from conflating them ([disc #773](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/773) has the worked example):

| Layer | Question | How to check |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Driver** | Is direct GPU↔GPU access *granted*? | `nvidia-smi topo -p2p rw` (= OK), module flavor (§5); strongest: a transfer-verified cache (§7) |
| **2. NCCL** | Is the granted path *used* for transfers? | `NCCL_P2P_LEVEL` set + layer 1 granted — this is where most of the P2P benefit flows, at any GPU count |
| **3. vLLM's custom all-reduce** | Is vLLM's *extra* kernel on top of NCCL active? | vLLM's own log: the `Custom allreduce is disabled…` line means no. At >2 GPUs it requires a **full NVLink mesh** and never consults P2P ([#786](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/786)) — so on 3+-card PCIe rigs layer 3 is always off, *by design, not misconfiguration*, and P2P still pays through layer 2 |

### Why layer 3's gate asks about NVLink and not peer access (2026-07-30)

Read from `vllm/distributed/device_communicators/custom_all_reduce.py` (verified identical in v0.24.0 and v0.25.1). **The NVLink test was never intended as the requirement — it is a cheap pre-filter in front of an expensive one**, and its own comments say so:

```python
# test nvlink first, this will filter out most of the cases
# where custom allreduce is not supported
fully_connected = current_platform.is_fully_connected(physical_device_ids)
if world_size > 2 and not fully_connected:
    logger.warning("Custom allreduce is disabled because it's not supported on"
                   " more than two PCIe-only GPUs. ...")
    return                      # <-- disqualifies, instead of falling through
# test P2P capability, this checks software/cudaruntime support
# this is expensive to compute at the first time
# then we cache the result
if not current_platform.is_rocm() and not _can_p2p(rank, world_size):
```

`gpu_p2p_access_check()` spawns subprocesses to test real transfers — slow on first call, hence cached. `is_fully_connected` exists to avoid paying that when it would fail anyway. The narrow defect: at `world_size > 2` the pre-filter `return`s rather than deferring to the P2P check a patched PCIe rig would pass. An early-out optimisation became a hard gate.

Two details confirming it is a heuristic and not a kernel limit:

- The condition is literally `world_size > 2`. **At TP=2 the NVLink test is skipped entirely**, which is exactly why dual-card PCIe rigs get layer 3 and 4-card rigs do not — the peer-access result is never consulted at world>2.
- `_SUPPORTED_WORLD_SIZES = [2, 4, 6, 8]` — the kernel itself supports 4 cards. Patching `is_fully_connected` works rather than crashing.

**Why `>2` plausibly exists** (inference from the algorithm shape, *not* stated upstream): custom AR has every rank write into every peer's buffer. At 2 GPUs that is one peer over one link; at 4 on a shared PCIe fabric the N−1 peer writes per rank contend for the same host-bridge bandwidth, while NVLink is point-to-point per pair and NCCL's ring/tree is topology-aware. It reads as an NVSwitch-era assumption never retested against P2P-patched consumer hardware.

**The 8 MiB cap is why forcing the gate is a tradeoff, not a free win.** `CustomAllreduce(max_size=8192 * 1024)` — tensors above 8 MiB fall back to NCCL regardless. So decode-sized tensors take the custom path and win, while prefill-sized ones exceed the cap, go through NCCL anyway, and still pay the registration overhead.

**We measured the bypass and deliberately do not ship it.** Forcing `is_fully_connected → True` at TP=4 on a patched 4×3090 gives **≈ +15% decode**, independently reproduced by [@superalesha](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/773#discussioncomment-17834828) at **+14.8%** (80.9 → 92.9 tok/s single-stream, 144 → 165 at 16 users) — **with prefill paying for it** (TTFT +9% at c16, consistent with the cap above). Note the flag is read twice, once to build the communicator and once in `should_custom_ar`, so a half-patch does nothing. club-3090 keeps the gate: the tradeoff is workload-dependent, and monkeypatching an engine's topology gate is not something we want in a default path on other people's rigs. The clean upstream fix is to let `world_size > 2` fall through to `_can_p2p` and gate on measured benefit instead of link type.

**Where NVLink fits:** a bridge is the native version of layer 1 (no patched driver needed) and a faster layer 2 for the bridged pair. Layer 3 follows the same mesh rule: **2× 3090 + bridge → all three layers on**; **4× 3090 with two pairwise bridges → layer 3 still off** (consumer cards bridge exactly two GPUs; full meshes are NVSwitch/SXM territory). `report.sh`'s *Interconnect verdict* (§7) resolves all three layers for you.

## 1. Reading your topology: why `PHB`, not `PIX`

`nvidia-smi topo -m` labels each GPU↔GPU link by the *closest common point* the two cards share:

| Code | Meaning | Relative speed |
|---|---|---|
| `NV#` | NVLink (# = number of links) | fastest |
| `PIX` | a single PCIe **switch** (one bridge hop) | fast |
| `PXB` | multiple PCIe switches | good |
| `PHB` | a PCIe **Host Bridge** (the CPU root complex) | PCIe-bound |
| `NODE` | across host bridges within one NUMA node | slower |
| `SYS` | across NUMA nodes / sockets | slowest |

`PIX` requires a physical **PCIe switch chip** (PLX/PEX) sitting between the two slots. Most server/workstation boards — the ROMED8-2T included — have **no PLX switch**: every slot routes straight to the CPU's IO die. So two GPUs in different slots meet at the **CPU host bridge**, and **`PHB` is the correct, expected result** — not a misconfiguration, and not something a "better slot" will turn into `PIX`. (You only see `PIX` on boards with an onboard PCIe switch, or via a PLX riser.)

`PHB` is **not** a dead end for P2P. It just means peer traffic crosses the CPU root complex rather than a dedicated switch. Whether P2P actually *engages* over `PHB` depends on three more things: NUMA placement (§2), BIOS/ACS (§4), and the driver (§5).

---

## 2. NUMA: keep both cards in one domain

EPYC (and multi-socket Xeon) can expose the socket as 1 or 4 NUMA nodes — `NPS1` / `NPS4` in BIOS. Under `NPS4`, two GPUs in different CPU quadrants can report `NODE` (or worse) instead of `PHB`, adding cross-die latency to every all-reduce.

**Set `NPS1`** (one NUMA node per socket) so both GPUs share a domain and report `PHB` — the cleanest single-socket layout for TP=2. On a true multi-socket box, keep both GPUs on the **same socket** (otherwise you get `SYS`, the worst case).

---

## 3. Physical slot choice (two triple-slot GPUs)

A 3-slot (triple-width) card like most 3090s covers its own slot **plus the two below it**, so you need slots spaced **≥3 positions apart**.

- Use the **first usable x16 slot + one three positions down** so the coolers don't collide and both cards train the full x16 width. On the ROMED8-2T (7× PCIe 4.0 x16 slots) that's typically the top slot paired with one ~3 slots lower — **check your board's manual block diagram for the exact pair**, since the spacing and which slots are full-x16 vary.
- **Mind lane-sharing with onboard M.2 / NVMe.** Many boards bifurcate or share lanes between a PCIe slot and an onboard M.2 (often jumper- or BIOS-gated). A populated M.2 can silently drop your second GPU slot to **x8**, or disable it. Consult the manual's lane-allocation / jumper table before committing a pair.
- **Always verify the *trained* width** after seating — a slot can negotiate lower than its physical size:
  ```bash
  nvidia-smi --query-gpu=index,pcie.link.width.current,pcie.link.gen.current --format=csv
  # or:  sudo lspci -vv | grep -E 'LnkCap|LnkSta'
  ```
  `report.sh` captures this automatically (it flags a slot that trained narrower than the GPU's capability).

---

## 4. BIOS settings that matter

| Setting | Set to | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Above 4G Decoding** | **Enabled** | Required to map large GPU BARs above the 4 GB boundary; prerequisite for ReBAR and for P2P BAR access. |
| **Re-Size BAR / Smart Access Memory** | **Enabled** | Lets the CPU address the full VRAM aperture; helps both model load and P2P. |
| **IOMMU** | **Off / passthrough** for bare-metal P2P; **On** only for VFIO/VM passthrough | An *enforcing* IOMMU + ACS routes peer traffic up to the root and back, defeating direct P2P. |
| **ACS (Access Control Services)** | **Disabled** for bare-metal P2P | ACS-redirect on the upstream port forces P2P transactions through the root complex — the **#1 silent P2P killer**. Leave **On** only if you need VM isolation (a genuine tradeoff). |
| **NPS** (EPYC) | **NPS1** | Keeps both GPUs in one NUMA domain (§2). |

> **⚠️ Ampere consumer cards: the ReBAR toggle is gated by GPU firmware, not the motherboard** (#734, @alexpolo1). On RTX 3090-class cards the BAR1 size ceiling comes from the **VBIOS** — with a launch-era (pre-ReBAR) VBIOS the BIOS toggle silently does nothing. Check before assuming:
>
> ```
> sudo lspci -vv -s <bus> | grep -A4 "Physical Resizable BAR"
> ```
>
> If `BAR 1: supported:` tops out at 256MB, the card needs a ReBAR VBIOS from its **board vendor** before any BIOS setting matters. And a ReBAR-*era* VBIOS date is not sufficient evidence: the reference rig's two 3090s run `94.02.42.*` (the ReBAR-era family) and still advertise `supported: 256MB` only. Trust the `lspci` `supported:` list, never the VBIOS date.

---

## 5. Enabling P2P on consumer GPUs

Two hard truths set expectations before you start:

1. **The stock NVIDIA driver refuses P2P on GeForce cards over `PHB`.** Even with perfect topology and BIOS, the consumer driver disables peer access. Enabling it requires a **patched kernel module** — the community [`aikitoria/open-gpu-kernel-modules`](https://github.com/aikitoria/open-gpu-kernel-modules) fork ([Sam McLeod's walkthrough](https://smcleod.net/2026/02/patching-nvidias-driver-and-vllm-to-enable-p2p-on-consumer-gpus/)). This is a custom DKMS module — weigh the maintenance cost. (Should the walkthrough link ever rot, the shape of it: clone the fork matching your driver branch → build + install via DKMS in place of the stock `nvidia` kernel module → reboot → `nvidia-smi topo -p2p r` should now report `OK` between your GPUs.)
2. **`PHB` P2P is PCIe-bounded** (~25 GB/s on PCIe 4.0 x16), well under NVLink. So the win is real but modest and workload-shaped (§6).
3. **Large BAR1 is a hard prerequisite for the patched-module path, not a nice-to-have** (#734). The patch maps the **full VRAM aperture through BAR1** (static BAR1 mapping) rather than using mailbox windows — a 256MB BAR1 cannot map 24GB, so on a card whose `lspci` `supported:` list caps at 256MB (§4 note) this path is unreachable **regardless of topology, IOMMU, or ACS**. Fix the firmware first or stop here.

> **Identifying your board for a VBIOS hunt** (#734): `nvidia-smi` reports `Board Part Number: N/A` on many AIB cards. A non-destructive ROM read surfaces the real board ID:
>
> ```
> echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/<dbdf>/rom
> sudo cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/<dbdf>/rom > card.rom
> echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/<dbdf>/rom
> strings card.rom | head -20
> ```
>
> Match the exact board string **and revision** against the vendor's VBIOS — same-vendor ROMs for a different cooler/board variant will flash but can brick or misbehave. Note the sysfs dump is often truncated (fine for ID, **not a backup**); use `nvflash --save` for a real pre-flash backup.

**On this stack**, once the patched module is installed you don't edit composes — set one env var:

```bash
# in your repo-root .env
NVLINK_MODE=pcie_p2p
```

`scripts/detect_nvlink.sh` then flips the dual/multi composes to `NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=PHB` + custom-all-reduce **ON** (and strips the `expandable_segments` alloc token that's incompatible with the custom-all-reduce IPC path — see [UPSTREAM.md → #42609](UPSTREAM.md)). The other `NVLINK_MODE` values: `auto` (default), `force_on` (NVLink present), `force_off` (PCIe, P2P off).

> If `nvidia-smi topo -p2p rw` already shows `OK` between your GPUs *without* the patched module (some server boards / layouts genuinely expose P2P), `detect_nvlink.sh` auto-enables the PCIe-P2P path on its own — no env var needed.

⚠️ **The flip side of auto-enable: installing the patched module changes launcher behavior by itself.** The next launch after the module is in place, `detect_nvlink.sh` sees the new `OK` grant and switches every dual/multi compose to the P2P path (`NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=PHB` + custom-all-reduce) with no config change on your side. A driver *grant* is not the same as *working transfers* — if the grant doesn't actually carry bytes (patch branch not matching your exact driver version, ACS/IOMMU redirecting peer TLPs, or a card family where P2P is hard-locked), NCCL blocks forever on its first peer operation and **every vLLM slug hangs silently at `pynccl` init with weights never loading** (§8). The escape hatch is always `NVLINK_MODE=force_off` in `.env`. Before trusting a fresh grant, run the transfer check (§7, `VLLM_SKIP_P2P_CHECK=0`) or cuda-samples `p2pBandwidthLatencyTest` — both move real bytes; the topo matrix does not.

> **Blackwell / 50-series (first field report, 2026-08-01):** P2P is deliberately driver-locked on GeForce Blackwell, and the patched-module path is **unvalidated** there — the first report (5090 pair, driver 610.43.03 + patch) got a granted `OK` matrix and the silent `pynccl` hang above. Treat 5090 P2P as experimental: validate with `p2pBandwidthLatencyTest` *before* letting the launcher auto-enable it, and expect the patch branch to lag new driver releases.

---

## 6. Realistic expectations

From cross-rig data on this stack (2× 3090, TP=2):

| Path | Measured gain | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `dual.yml` (fp8 KV) — patched P2P vs unpatched | **+2% narrative / +9% code** | [#91](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/91) |
| DFlash / spec-decode path — patched P2P | **+19–22%** | [#95](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/95) |
| NVLink hardware — workload-shaped (same-host A/B) | **decode +3–5% · prefill/long-ctx +35–49%** | [#698](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/698) — supersedes the flat ~+15% from [#77](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/77) (older v7.72.2 image) |

**Translation:** code / spec-decode workloads see a real lift (the K+1 cross-card verify is bandwidth-bound, so it benefits most); narrative decode barely moves. For most users the stock no-P2P PCIe path is already perfectly fine — **P2P is an enthusiast tuning lever, not a requirement.**

⚠️ **These are DUAL-card measurements — do not extrapolate them to 3+ GPUs.** At world_size > 2 without NVLink, **vLLM force-disables its custom all-reduce kernel** (its gate queries NVML for NVLink and never consults peer access — [#786](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/786)), so whatever P2P is worth at TP=4 arrives **through NCCL peer transfers only** — a lower ceiling than the dual-card custom-kernel path above. An earlier revision claimed the gain "grows with GPU count"; that was a projection, not a measurement, and stays withdrawn. **UPDATE 2026-07-30 — a measured multi-GPU A/B now exists, on ONE rig:** [disc #773](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/773) (4× 3090, patched P2P, vLLM 0.25.1, MTP n=3, 220 W, one sitting) reports TP=2 → TP=4 as **prefill +55% @10K / +62% @90K, TTFT −38% @90K, decode +4.0% prose / −2.6% code**. Read it as *four cards read faster; they do not write faster* — the win is prefill and TTFT, and the decode column is inside run-to-run noise. It is one rig, one sitting, and it is a **TP-scaling** A/B (2 vs 4 cards, P2P on throughout), **not** a P2P-on-vs-off A/B at fixed TP — that one still does not exist. So: do not extrapolate "P2P scales with GPU count" from it, and do not cite the decode figures as a P2P result.

---

## 7. Verifying P2P actually engaged

Capability (`topo -m` / `topo -p2p`) tells you it *can* — it doesn't tell you it *did*. After launching a serving container:

```bash
bash scripts/report.sh
```

Read the **"Interconnect verdict"** line under *Boot log highlights* — the report cross-references host capability against the running container's engagement automatically: `✓ engaged`, `⚠ WARN` (NVLink bridge present but idle), or `ℹ` (P2P-capable driver, container not using it), each naming the fix. The raw evidence sits directly above it: the `[nvlink]` boot line plus the resolved `NCCL_P2P_LEVEL` + custom-all-reduce env. On rigs with no P2P capability the verdict line is deliberately absent — silence means "nothing to gain here", not "check failed". (This is exactly the round-trip the field was added to avoid — [#446](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/446), [#488](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/488).)

**On 3+ PCIe cards, expect "engaged via NCCL", not "custom all-reduce ON".** vLLM vetoes its custom kernel at world_size > 2 without NVLink and logs `Custom allreduce is disabled because it's not supported on more than two PCIe-only GPUs` — that line is **expected on every 3+-card PCIe rig, patched or not**, and is not a misconfiguration. The same veto fires on **pairwise NVLink bridges** at 3+ cards (2 bridges on 4x 3090 is never a full 1-hop mesh — consumer cards bridge exactly two GPUs), so a quad-3090-with-bridges rig is also NCCL-only in vLLM; only NVSwitch/SXM-class full meshes keep the custom kernel at world>2. The report folds it into the verdict automatically ([#786](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/issues/786)); P2P remains active on the NCCL path.

**Transfer-verified P2P — the strongest evidence tier.** Everything above is ultimately a driver *assertion* (the topo matrix, the module license, a clean boot — all the same query asked three ways). vLLM ships a functional check that actually moves bytes: boot once with `VLLM_SKIP_P2P_CHECK=0` and it performs an IPC write/read-back across every directed GPU pair, caching the result to `~/.cache/vllm/gpu_p2p_access_cache_for_<devices>.json`. `report.sh` reads that cache automatically when present (host first, then the serving container) and adds a **"Transfer check"** line — `✓ N/N directed pairs OK` upgrades the verdict from driver-asserted to *measured*, and a partial result flags advertised-but-broken peer access that no driver query can see. The check costs seconds and the cache is a durable, paste-able artifact (idea from [disc #773](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/773)).

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause → fix |
|---|---|
| `topo -m` shows `NODE` / `SYS`, not `PHB` | Wrong NUMA placement → set `NPS1`; reseat both GPUs in same-NUMA (same-socket) slots. |
| Second GPU trains at **x8** or disappears | A populated M.2 / adjacent slot is stealing its lanes → move the card or clear the bifurcation jumper (board manual). |
| `topo -p2p rw` shows `CNS` ("chipset not supported") | Stock driver refusing P2P on consumer GPU → install the patched module (§5), then re-check. |
| `topo -p2p rw` shows `GNS` **and** `lspci` `BAR 1: supported:` caps at 256MB | **Pre-ReBAR / BAR1-capped VBIOS** — a firmware gate, not a driver or topology problem (#734). No BIOS setting or driver swap helps; the §5 patched path needs large BAR1. Vendor ReBAR VBIOS first (§4 note + the board-ID tip in §5), then re-check `supported:`. |
| Boot crash after enabling P2P: `custom_all_reduce.cuh … invalid argument` | Known `expandable_segments` ↔ custom-all-reduce IPC clash → `detect_nvlink.sh` strips the token on the P2P path automatically; ensure you're on a current pin ([UPSTREAM.md → #42609](UPSTREAM.md)). |
| **vLLM slugs HANG at `pynccl` init after installing a patched driver/module** (last line `vLLM is using nccl==…`, weights never load, no error) | The driver now *grants* P2P, so `detect_nvlink.sh` auto-enabled the P2P path (§5) — but the grant doesn't carry actual transfers, so NCCL blocks on its first peer op. **Unblock: `NVLINK_MODE=force_off` in `.env`, relaunch** (back to pre-patch behavior). Then validate the grant with raw transfers: cuda-samples `p2pBandwidthLatencyTest`, or §7's `VLLM_SKIP_P2P_CHECK=0` transfer check. If raw P2P hangs/reads garbage: match the patch branch to your **exact** driver version, check ACS (`lspci -vvv \| grep ACSCtl` — ACS redirect stalls peer TLPs; disable ACS/IOMMU per §4), or accept the card family is hard-locked (GeForce Blackwell — §5 note). Common right after a driver upgrade: the patch fork lags new driver branches. |
| Raw `p2pBandwidthLatencyTest` passes but vLLM still hangs | The grant works; the issue is in the NCCL/custom-AR layer. Rerun one slug with `NCCL_DEBUG=INFO` and read the last transport lines; try `NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1` in the compose env to split NCCL peer transport from the custom-all-reduce path, and re-check the `expandable_segments` row above. |
| Enabled it but TPS didn't move | Check it actually engaged (§7); then check your workload — narrative decode barely benefits, code/spec-decode does (§6). |
