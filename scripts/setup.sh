# What it does (per supported model):
#   - clones Sandermage/genesis-vllm-patches into models/<model>/vllm/patches/genesis
#     (vLLM-only; skip with SKIP_GENESIS=1 if you only need llama.cpp / SGLang;
#     Gemma 4 doesn't fetch Genesis at all yet)
#   - downloads model weights into $MODEL_DIR with SHA256 verification against
#     the hub's published x-linked-etag (no-redirect resolve HEAD via
#     scripts/lib/profiles/hf_fetch.py). A file the hub publishes no hash for is
#     reported UNVERIFIED and EXCLUDED from the verified count — "verified"
#     never attaches to a size-only check (#857)
#   - downloads the always-required drafter (Gemma 4: MTP "assistant"; Qwen3.6:
#     no always-required drafter — DFlash is optional via WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1)
#
# Env vars (optional):
#   MODEL_DIR           Where to place model weights. Default: <repo>/models-cache
#   WEIGHTS             'autoround' (default, vLLM INT4) or 'gguf' (llama.cpp /
#                       ik_llama). gguf fetches the Q4_K_M MTP GGUF + mmproj for
#                       the llamacpp/* + ik-llama/* composes (qwen3.6-27b only),
#                       and skips Genesis. Use this if you're serving via
#                       llama.cpp/ik_llama rather than vLLM.
#   HF_TOKEN            HF token (public models, usually unnecessary)
#   SKIP_MODEL          Set to 1 to skip the model download step
#   SKIP_GENESIS        Set to 1 to skip cloning Genesis patches
#   WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT   Set to 1 to ALSO download the model family's DFlash
#                       drafter when one is registered in profiles/models/*.yml.
#                       Default: 0.
#                       Note: draft model is still under training as of
#                       2026-04-26; bench numbers in DUAL_CARD.md were
#                       measured against that snapshot. AL improvements
#                       expected when z-lab tags training-complete.
#   PREFLIGHT_DISK_GB   Required free space at MODEL_DIR (default: 25, or
#                       28 if WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1)
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run — skips steps already done.

#      which lives on the FIRST hop, read as "not published" on every modern
#      repo. The SKIP was the normal outcome, not a rare edge (#857).
#   2. One implementation means the downloader and setup.sh cannot disagree
#      about what "verified" means. They already did, and the weaker surface
#      was the one printing the reassuring line.
#
# Prints "<sha256|-> <size|->" and returns 0 when the hub answered at all;
# returns non-zero only when the lookup itself failed. A literal "-" in the hash
# field means the hub published NO sha256 for this file — the caller MUST treat
