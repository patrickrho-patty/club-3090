# report a user is about to send us. A caller-side `|| echo 0` cannot rescue it
# either: the function already exited 0, its last command having been the echo.

# P2P!" is WRONG for most rigs that would see it: cards on separate root
# complexes can never peer regardless of driver, and a BAR1 smaller than VRAM
# cannot back the patched module's static full-VRAM mapping (#734) — telling
# either of those users to build a DKMS module wastes their evening. The
# reference 2x3090 is itself the BAR1 case, which is why B outranks A.

Two separate reasons: layer split forwards activations with plain copies so there is no all-reduce at all, AND the ggml-org image is built WITHOUT NCCL — it logs 'NCCL not compiled in; falling back to internal AllReduce' and that fallback does not use the peer path, so even tensor split cannot benefit. Verified: zero NCCL symbols in server-cuda-b10236. If you serve only GGUF, this lever is not worth a DKMS rebuild unless you also rebuild llama.cpp with -DGGML_CUDA_NCCL=ON."
