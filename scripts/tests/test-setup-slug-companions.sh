# test-setup-slug-companions.sh — `setup.sh <slug>` must fetch everything the slug needs.
#
# WHY: a slug's `weights_companions` (a drafter / vision projector its compose mounts)
# reached setup.sh only through the serve-cockpit's Download action. A CLI download
# of the model got the core weights and left a slug that crash-loops on a missing
# drafter (#1247). `setup.sh <slug>` now resolves the slug through the registry.
# This guard checks, for one slug per distinct (model, variant, companions) set:
#   - the primary key is <model>:<weights_variant> (what the cockpit sends);
#   - every companion is queued for download (or is already the primary / the
#     model's always-fetched drafter), and resolves in the weights catalog;
# plus the overrides and the unknown-slug refusal, as negative controls.
