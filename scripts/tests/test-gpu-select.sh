# test-gpu-select.sh — the shared GPU-UUID resolver (#610 Phase A) has TWO
# implementations that MUST agree: scripts/lib/gpu-select.sh (bash, for
# launch.sh) and resolve_gpu_uuids() in estate_cli.py (python, for the estate
# boot path). This guard asserts:
#   1. both resolve the SAME indices to the SAME UUID csv (real nvidia-smi);
#   2. both fall back to empty/None identically when a resolver can't run
#      (fake-GPU test mode / no nvidia-smi);
#   3. gpu_select_export sets both CUDA_ and NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES;
#   4. the launcher sources the lib (no re-inlined resolver drift).

# Repo sources are full of unicode (— × → ⚠), and without this a rig on a real
# non-UTF-8 locale (de_DE.iso88591 and friends) decodes reads, stdout AND argv
# with the locale codec, which crashes the launcher/emit paths (#779). Python
# already auto-enables UTF-8 mode for the C/POSIX locale, so this covers the
# case it does NOT: a genuine non-UTF-8, non-C locale. Exported, so child
# processes and nested scripts inherit it. Guarded by test-locale-utf8.sh.
