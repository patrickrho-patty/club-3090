# test-deepgemm-fp8-parity — every fp8/NVFP4-weights vLLM compose MUST carry the
# `- VLLM_USE_DEEP_GEMM` pass-through so the launcher's consumer-Blackwell
# auto-disable (_deepgemm_env, sm {8.9, 12.0, 12.1}) actually reaches the
# container. Without the receiving line, docker-compose drops the injected
# VLLM_USE_DEEP_GEMM=0 and a 5090 / PRO 6000 / GB10 user hits the fp8-GEMM
# "recipe not found" boot crash (disc #571 / #580; NVFP4 follow-up #613).
#
# This guards the sibling-compose DRIFT class: dual-max carried the line
# (added in #580) but multi-max / dual-lmcache / diffusiongemma-dual — the
# same fp8-weights config — had silently drifted without it. NVFP4 ModelOpt
# composes also route their FP8 attention/linear layers through DeepGEMM. These composes
# are hand-maintained parallel copies (no extends/include), so nothing else
# keeps them in sync.

# Force Python's UTF-8 mode (PEP 540) for every python3 this script runs.
# Repo sources are full of unicode (— × → ⚠), and without this a rig on a real
# non-UTF-8 locale (de_DE.iso88591 and friends) decodes reads, stdout AND argv
# with the locale codec, which crashes the launcher/emit paths (#779). Python
# already auto-enables UTF-8 mode for the C/POSIX locale, so this covers the
# case it does NOT: a genuine non-UTF-8, non-C locale. Exported, so child
# processes and nested scripts inherit it. Guarded by test-locale-utf8.sh.
