# compaction-probe.sh — does throughput degrade AFTER a context compaction at depth?
#
# The reported shape (#1052, @xtj7): "generating around 140k tokens and when I
# compact I suddenly see the live TPS drop to around 25 and stay [there]".
#
# Nothing we ship measured that. `bench-agentic.sh` grows a conversation
# MONOTONICALLY and never compacts; `gdn-mtp-apc-repro.py` likewise. Compaction is
# a distinct event: a long history is replaced by a short summary, which
# invalidates most of the prefix cache and forces a fresh prefill against
# already-warm GDN/SSM state — and it is a PEAK-MEMORY moment, because the new
# sequence prefills while the old blocks are still held.
#
# Shape:
#   1 GROW     inflate context to FILL_FRAC x max_ctx
#   2 BEFORE   N short generations at depth  -> baseline
#   3 COMPACT  history -> summary + last turn
#   4 AFTER    N short generations           -> comparison
#
# ⚠️ FILL_FRAC defaults to 0.90, NOT 0.95. verify-stress measured this class of
# model fillable to 91% of n_ctx with only 669 MB free, under its own 1024 MB
# margin threshold. Compaction needs headroom for the new prefill on top of that,
# so a 0.95 default would measure an OOM rather than the thing being asked about.
# Raise it deliberately (FILL_FRAC=0.95) to probe the edge; the preflight warns.
#
# ⚠️ TPS comes from vLLM's OWN counters as well as client wall time. Client-side
# timing on a reasoning model is easy to get wrong — that is exactly what #1096
# turned out to be (reasoning deltas charged to prefill) — so the engine figure is
# the citable one. Requests are greedy + seeded so reps are comparable.
#
# Env:
#   URL         endpoint. Default: the curated default port, like bench.sh
#   MODEL       served model id. Default: auto-detected from /v1/models
#   FILL_FRAC   fraction of max_ctx to fill before compacting. Default: 0.90
#   REPS        generations per phase. Default: 5
#   MAX_CTX     override the model's advertised context
