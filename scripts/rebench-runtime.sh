# rebench-runtime.sh — the "runtime" tier of rebench: verify-full (preflight)
# + bench + verify-stress + soak, skipping the two generation-quality legs
# (quality-full think-OFF + quality-thinking think-ON).
#
# WHEN TO USE THIS instead of rebench-full.sh:
#   When you changed a serving-config knob that affects throughput / VRAM /
#   stability but NOT per-token generation quality, so re-scoring the 8-pack
#   twice (think-OFF + think-ON) would be ~1.5-2.5 hr of wasted cycles that can
#   only reproduce the prior scores. Examples:
#     - context-size ceiling bump (KV *type* unchanged)
#     - --ubatch-size / --batch-size tuning
#     - --gpu-memory-utilization / --mem-fraction-static
#     - power-limit sweep
#     - MTP n / draft-p-min retune (TPS + accept-rate, not answer text)
#   If the change DOES touch generation (quant swap, KV-cache *type* change,
#   chat-template change, model swap) → run full rebench-full.sh instead.
#
# Preflight + three legs (≈30-40 min on single-card, vs ~2.5-3.5 hr for the
# full matrix):
#   0. verify-full.sh     — functional preflight, FAIL-FAST (inherited from
#                           rebench-full; NOT skipped — a runtime knob can break
#                           serving, so we still gate on it)
#   1. bench.sh           — TPS narrative + code
#   2. verify-stress.sh   — long-context needle ladder + prefill-OOM boundary
#   3. soak-test.sh       — accumulating-context endurance (Cliff 2b)
#
# Usage (identical surface to rebench-full.sh — all flags pass through):
#   bash scripts/rebench-runtime.sh                       # auto-detect running compose
#   bash scripts/rebench-runtime.sh --tag ik-262k         # explicit tag
#   bash scripts/rebench-runtime.sh --skip soak           # ALSO skip soak (merged)
#
# ⚠️ STALE ADVICE CORRECTED 2026-09-19. This used to say soak-test.sh's container
# auto-detect "only matches vllm-*" (see #403) and that you must pass CONTAINER
# explicitly for llama.cpp / ik_llama. That is no longer true: soak-test.sh now
# resolves the container from the REGISTRY via scripts/lib/club-containers.sh, so
# every catalogued engine — including sglang and exl3, which the old hand-written
# prefix list missed — is auto-detected. Passing them explicitly still works and
# is still the right move on a multi-model endpoint:
#   CONTAINER=ik-llama-qwen36-27b URL=http://localhost:8020 MODEL=ik-iq4ks-mtp \
#     bash scripts/rebench-runtime.sh --engine llama-cpp
#
# This is a thin preset over rebench-full.sh: it injects
# `--skip quality-full,quality-thinking` and merges any --skip you pass.
# (verify-full is intentionally NOT skipped — it's the fail-fast preflight.)
