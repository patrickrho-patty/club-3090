# test-report-resolved-config — report.sh must say what the ENGINE actually ran,
# and must never hand a secret to a GitHub issue while doing it (club-3090#1265).
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
# --------------------
# `report.sh --full` profiled the rig exhaustively and captured nothing about the
# engine's configuration, so an unexpected number in a community report was
# unattributable. #1261 is the worked example: a clean report, and the three
# findings that mattered (--mem-fraction-static, --chunked-prefill-size, the
# drafter identity) came only from a boot log the reporter happened to paste.
#
# THE ASSERTIONS HAVE TO DISCRIMINATE, AND MOST NAIVE ONES DO NOT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Two traps this file is written around:
#
#   1. "the report mentions X" can pass PRE-FIX. report.sh has carried a
#      per-GPU wattage since its first commit, which is why the power-state
#      test asserts on interpretation rather than presence. Every assertion
#      here therefore keys on content that exists ONLY if the feature ran: the
#      literal verdict strings, the slug, and a flag's BOTH values.
#
#   2. ⚠️⚠️ "no token appears in the report" ALSO passes pre-fix — trivially,
#      because a pre-fix report never reads .Config.Env at all. A leak test
#      alone therefore proves nothing. So the redaction case asserts, in the
#      same run and against the same fixture: the env block IS present, it DOES
#      carry a known allowlisted knob with its value, AND the planted token is
#      absent. Only the conjunction discriminates — leg 5 is a live negative
#      control that removes the allowlist and proves the leak assertion can
#      actually fail.
#
# Contract asserted here:
#   - a stock slug says so in ONE line, naming the slug;
#   - a modified slug lists exactly which flag differs, with BOTH values;
#   - an override read only INSIDE the container (llama.cpp's SPEC=off, which
#     leaves argv byte-identical) is still caught — argv alone is a false clean;
#   - a hand-rolled compose says "unrecognised", and still prints the flags,
#     because for an unrecognised launch argv is the only evidence there is;
#   - the env allowlist is an ALLOWLIST: a planted token, an unknown var and a
#     credential living inside an allowed prefix family are all withheld, and
#     that holds under --no-redact;
#   - no-docker / daemon-down / missing-container each say so DISTINCTLY, so an
#     empty capture can never read like a clean one;
#   - the section is bounded — it must not grow by the size of the compose.

# --- 2h. SGLang startup dump: BOTH shapes yield real values -----------------
# SGLang <= v0.5.19 logs `server_args=ServerArgs(key=value, ...)`; v0.5.20 logs
# a dict, `server_args={'key': value, ...}`. The key=value regex read only the
# first, so on v0.5.20 every report rendered "elided to 0 keys" — and no leg in
# this file ever fed a boot log, so nothing noticed. The dict fixture also
# plants a NESTED tp_size BEFORE the top-level one: a regex over the dict text
# would report 99; only a real parse reports 2. (Outside the HAVE_COMPOSE gate:
# the dump read needs no `docker compose`.)
