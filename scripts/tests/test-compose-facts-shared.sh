# Guard: compose-fact derivation has exactly ONE implementation, reachable from
# BOTH the CLI (scripts/) and the cockpit (tools/serve-cockpit/).
#
# Why this exists (#1202 P1): derive_compose_facts used to live inside
# club3090_cockpit.data. Nothing outside the cockpit could import it, which is
# *why* the local model layer was write-only from the UI (#1153) -- the UI owned
# the only implementation of compose->spec derivation. It now lives in
# scripts/lib/profiles/compose_facts.py and the cockpit delegates.
#
# The failure this pins is a silent re-fork: someone "fixes" a parsing bug in one
# consumer and the two drift. The test derives the SAME compose through BOTH
# import paths and requires byte-identical results.
