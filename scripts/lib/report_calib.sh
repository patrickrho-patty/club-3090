# scripts/lib/report_calib.sh — helpers for report.sh's "KV math calibration"
# section (club-3090 #168). Pure functions: sourcing this file has no side
# effects, so it can be unit-tested directly (see scripts/tests/test-report-calib.sh).
#
# Why these exist:
#   - kv-calc's prediction model is vLLM-memory-model-coupled, so its
#     calibration is not a valid sanity-check on the llama.cpp / ik_llama
#     (ggml) engines — those must be skipped.
#   - `kv-calc.py --calibration` always prints the full catalog (all 4 models);
#     a bug-reporter should see only the model they're actually running.

# Map a running container name to its kv-calc engine family.
# Echoes: vllm | llamacpp | unknown
# "llamacpp" intentionally covers BOTH mainline llama.cpp and ik_llama — both
# use the ggml allocator, so kv-calc's vLLM memory model applies to neither.
# Delegates to the canonical resolver (club-3090#1282) — do NOT re-inline the
# prefix arms here; scripts/lib/engine-kind.sh is the single source of truth.

# Filter `kv-calc.py --calibration` output (stdin) to a single model's section.

# Arg 1: model id. If empty, passes stdin through unchanged (full matrix).
# ⚠️⚠️ The `Overall:` line is GLOBAL — it is the verdict across every calibrated
# model, not the scoped one. Printing it unconditionally while the target model
# has NO section produced a false clean: report.sh read the borrowed verdict,
# found no FAIL rows (because no rows were emitted at all), and asserted "No FAIL
# rows. kv-calc projections should agree with measured VRAM" for a model that was
# never evaluated. Reported by foureight84 on discussion #1076: `report.sh --full`
# scored 8/8 on a qwen3.8-27b multi4 boot while calibrating only qwen3.6-27b /
# 35b-a3b / agentworld / gemma-4-31b rows, because multi4-ultramax has no measured
# BENCHMARKS.md anchor.
#
# Emits a machine-readable marker when the scoped model has no section, so the
# caller can refuse to report a verdict it did not earn.
