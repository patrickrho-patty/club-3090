"""club3090 serve cockpit — main Textual application.

The two modes (Run & Operate · Bring & Validate) are wired to the real data layer
(``services.CockpitData`` + ``data.py`` shapes), reusing the shared core
(``club3090_tui_core``) for detect / streaming / widgets.  (R1 folded the former
Discover + Serve + Benchmarks modes into a single Run mode; R2a renamed the
Estate mode to Operate and moved the Doctor surface into it.)

  - Run / Catalog        : real enriched rows from ``CockpitData.load_catalog``;
                          ``e`` opens ``explain`` (incl. the folded-in cross-rig
                          benchmark rows), ``/`` filters, ``⏎`` builds the GATED
                          ``serve(slug)`` plan and opens the reconcile-gated
                          ConfirmActionScreen — on confirm the boot streams into
                          the transient Run LivePane (#serve-live).
  - Run / BYO            : ``CockpitData.byo_check`` → fit verdict + swap_path.
  - Operate / Orch       : ``estate_state`` live (GPU cards, scenes, services,
                          power-cap); scene-switch → confirm modal that FIRST calls
                          ``reconcile_before_write`` then ``scene_switch``; ``c``
                          opens the power-cap menu (default 230W / clear / custom
                          W), each gated.  (prune removed; cap-sweep → Doctor.)
  - Operate / Containers : ``containers`` real list; drill into Logs/Top/Config;
                          restart/stop/rm behind the reconcile-gated confirm.
  - Operate / Doctor     : "is it serving correctly?" — health.sh (live) + verify
                          ([v] verify.sh test query) + verify-full ([V]) cards, all
                          READ-only; [R] basic report, [F] full battery (warned);
                          ``w`` power-cap sweep (gated tuning bench).
  - Validate / Run       : launchable ladder + extra tools (``run_validation``,
                          confirm-gated, streamed into a LivePane) + §3.5 *tune*
                          gotchas inline.
  - Validate / Evidence  : ``evidence_list()`` run tags; ``⏎`` opens the
                          ``evidence_report()`` modal; ``s`` stages the gated
                          submit-to-localmaxxing (outward NETWORK write, never auto).

EVERY GPU-claiming write (serve / scene-switch / estate-down / container
restart|stop|rm) goes through ``CockpitData.execute_action``, which re-runs the
reconcile gate first and refuses when unsafe (unless an explicit, reasoned force
override).  Heavy/destructive non-GPU writes (validation launches, submit-bench
POST, power-cap, cap-sweep) are confirm-gated too.  The write runner / network are
NEVER executed live — tests inject fakes and conftest blocks the real spawn.

    Stock ``Footer`` is ``can_focus_children=False`` and its ``FooterKey`` items

    every footer key Tab-focusable so a keyboard user could Tab onto a footer
    affordance — but footer keys render NO visible focus ring, so Tab-stepping
    through ~10 of them created an invisible-focus black hole between the tab bar

    advertised HOTKEYS (app/screen BINDINGS, independent of footer focus) and via
    mouse click (stock ``Footer`` behaviour), so footer keys add no value to the
    Tab chain.  We therefore keep the stock ``can_focus_children=False`` and do
    NOT mark any ``FooterKey`` focusable — Tab cycles only the VISIBLE, meaningful
    stops (the tab bar + the active list).

    Recompose guard (retained): the stock Footer recomposes on EVERY
