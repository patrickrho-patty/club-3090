Collective-level P2P validation — the tier below `nvidia-smi topo -p2p` and copy benchmarks.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  A driver reporting `topo -p2p = OK`, a passing `p2pBandwidthLatencyTest`, and a successful
  `cuMemSetAccess` do NOT prove NCCL works. All three were true, on the same rig, while every
  collective deadlocked — and one NCCL setting made them return wrong data instead.

  The reason is structural: a copy benchmark *synchronizes after* the transfer, so it can ride
  completion-time flushing. NCCL's producer and consumer kernels stay resident and must observe
  each other's writes while both are still running. Any copy-then-sync test passes on a mapping
  where NCCL cannot work.

WHAT IT DOES
  Runs the same tiny all-reduce twice:
    ARM A — P2P as the driver currently has it
    ARM B — NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1 (host-staged control; should ALWAYS pass)
  Small (4 B) and large (16 MiB) payloads, because NCCL selects different protocols by size
  (LL vs Simple) and they can fail differently.

  Ranks contribute 1.0 and 2.0, so every element must return exactly 3.0. Correctness is checked,
  not merely completion — a collective that finishes with the wrong answer is worse than one that
  hangs, and that failure mode is real (NCCL_P2P_USE_CUDA_MEMCPY=1 produced it).

  Arm B is what makes the result trustworthy: if the control also fails, the verdict is
  INCONCLUSIVE rather than a false P2P accusation.

SAFETY
  Read-only. ~16 MiB per GPU. Changes no configuration, writes no files. Each arm runs in its own
  process group under a hard timeout, so a hang is killed rather than left wedging the machine.

USAGE
  python3 p2p_collective_check.py            # uses GPUs 0,1
  GPUS=0,3 TIMEOUT_S=120 python3 p2p_collective_check.py

  Normally invoked via scripts/p2p-validate.sh, which runs it inside a container that has torch.

EXIT CODES
  0 healthy · 2 collectives hang · 3 collectives return wrong data · 4 inconclusive · 5 unusable
