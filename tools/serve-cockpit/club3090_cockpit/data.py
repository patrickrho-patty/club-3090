"""Cockpit data models — the typed shapes the panes consume.

This module is **pure**: no subprocess, no I/O, no Textual.  It defines the
dataclasses produced by ``services.CockpitData`` and the small parsing helpers
that turn raw contract output (JSON dicts / health.sh text) into those shapes.

Keeping these here (separate from ``services.py``) lets the panes and the tests
import the shapes without dragging in the subprocess machinery, and lets the
service layer be fully dependency-injected against a fake runner.

The enriched catalog row (``CatalogEntry``) wraps the shared-core ``VariantRow``
(never re-implements it) and layers on the join results: the local-card fit
verdict, measured TPS / 8-pack, and provenance.

    For each compute-app: read its cgroup body (``cgroup_by_pid[pid]``), pull the

    cgroup is missing/unreadable, isn't a docker process, or whose id isn't in the
    running-ps map keeps ``container=""`` — the pane then shows ``pid <N>
    (<vram>)`` with NO fabricated name.

    Returns ``(apps, degraded)`` where ``degraded`` is True when at least one app
    holding VRAM could not be named — the card appends a "(names unavailable)"
    cue so the user knows the *holder total* is honest even if a name is missing.
    The id map matches on the 64-hex id by prefix tolerance (docker ps --no-trunc
