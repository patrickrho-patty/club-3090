"""#1363 matrix guard — every registry slug x every hardware profile.

Asserts three properties of resolve_variant_pin():

  A. TOTAL      it does not raise for a registered slug
  B. ALLOWLIST  every emitted key is accepted by BOTH launchers' case arms
                (a key in one and not the other still hard-fails `exit 2`)
  C. CONSUMED   every emitted key appears as ${KEY:- in that slug's own compose
                -- never emit a variable the compose does not read

A and C are expected-red today and are tracked; B must be GREEN, because an
unallowlisted key is not a silent no-op -- it is `exit 2`, an unlaunchable slug.
