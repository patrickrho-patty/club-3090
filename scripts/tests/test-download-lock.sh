# Guard: the per-repo download lock in downloader.download_model (club-3090
# #617 — repeated ① Bring [D] presses spawned 5 concurrent hf downloads racing
# into the same .incomplete). Asserts:
#   1. a 2nd download while a LIVE holder exists is REFUSED (failure=in-progress,
#      detail carries the holder pid) — never races/rmtrees the first's staging;
#   2. a STALE lock (dead holder — a crashed/SIGKILL'd download) is RECLAIMED
#      and the fetch proceeds, and the lock is RELEASED afterwards;
#   3. read_active_download reflects live-vs-stale.

# Force Python's UTF-8 mode (PEP 540) for every python3 this script runs.
# Repo sources are full of unicode (— × → ⚠), and without this a rig on a real
# non-UTF-8 locale (de_DE.iso88591 and friends) decodes reads, stdout AND argv
# with the locale codec, which crashes the launcher/emit paths (#779). Python
# already auto-enables UTF-8 mode for the C/POSIX locale, so this covers the
# case it does NOT: a genuine non-UTF-8, non-C locale. Exported, so child
# processes and nested scripts inherit it. Guarded by test-locale-utf8.sh.
