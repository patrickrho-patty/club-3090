"""resolved_config.py — what the ENGINE ACTUALLY RAN, and how it differs from
the shipped recipe (club-3090#1265).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`report.sh` profiled the rig thoroughly and captured NOTHING about the engine's
configuration: eight `docker inspect` calls, never for `Config.Cmd`,
`Config.Entrypoint` or `Config.Env`.  So an unexpected number in a report was
unattributable — we could not tell a shipped recipe from a modified one.  #1261
is the worked example: a clean `--full` report, and the three findings that
mattered (`--mem-fraction-static 0.82` vs the recipe's 0.91,
`--chunked-prefill-size 2048` vs 1024, and the drafter identity) came only from
a boot log the reporter happened to paste into a comment.

⛔ WHY WE DO NOT DUMP THE COMPOSE FILE
-------------------------------------
The obvious implementation is wrong, not merely incomplete:

1. A compose is a TEMPLATE, not a configuration.  Ours are almost entirely
   `${VAR:-default}`, so the text shows DEFAULTS.  A user who exports
   `MEM_FRACTION=0.82` changes not one byte of the file — the exact case this
   module exists to detect stays invisible.
2. The launchers OVERRIDE the compose.  `switch.sh`/`launch.sh` resolve the
   engine image from `scripts/lib/profiles/engines/<engine>.yml` `install.spec`
   and inject it, beating the compose's own `image:` default.  A compose dump
   would therefore print the WRONG engine image — institutionalising a trap this
   stack already documents.

MEASURED, not assumed (2026-09-12, this rig, a throwaway 2-line compose):

    compose text                  docker compose config       .Config.Cmd
    ${MEM_FRACTION:-0.91}   ->    host-sub=0.91          ->   host-sub=0.82
    $${MEM_FRACTION:-...}   ->    $${MEM_FRACTION:-...}  ->   ${MEM_FRACTION:-...}

i.e. single-`$` interpolation happens on the HOST at launch, so `.Config.Cmd`
carries the RESOLVED value; `docker compose config` run in a clean environment
re-renders the same script with the recipe's defaults; and `$$` survives into
`config` output but is unescaped to `$` in the real container.  That last row is
why `_normalise_script` exists — without it every `$$` line would read as a
difference.

WHAT WE CAPTURE, in increasing order of authority
-------------------------------------------------
(a) What the CONTAINER received — `docker inspect` `.Config.{Image,Entrypoint,
    Cmd,Env}`.  Authoritative for launcher injection and env overrides.
(b) What the ENGINE resolved — its own startup dump, where an `auto` gets
    concretised (`--kv-cache-dtype auto -> fp8_e4m3` is visible nowhere else).
    ELIDED to the keys that matter by default; `--engine-args` prints the dump.
(c) ⭐ A DIFF against the shipped recipe — the actual ask.  Resolve the slug
    through the registry, re-render the recipe in a clean environment, print
    only the delta.  Where the slug is unrecognised, SAY SO — never print
    nothing and let it read as "no differences".

SECRETS: ALLOWLIST, NEVER A DENYLIST
------------------------------------
`.Config.Env` carries `HF_TOKEN`, `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN`, gateway keys.  A
denylist fails open the first time someone adds a new secret, so a name must
MATCH the allowlist to print at all.  Two notes on the shape of that allowlist:

  * It is NOT derived from the composes' own `environment:` lists, even though
    that would self-maintain: 75 shipped composes declare
    `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` there, so a compose-derived allowlist would leak
    the token by construction.
  * The prefix families (`VLLM_`, `LLAMA_ARG_`, `SGLANG_`, …) each contain a
    real credential var — llama-server reads `LLAMA_ARG_API_KEY`, vLLM reads
    `VLLM_API_KEY`.  `_NAME_VETO` removes those shapes from within an allowed
    family.  It is a SECOND GATE, not the mechanism: a name outside the
    allowlist never prints no matter what the veto says.

The allowlist is enforced regardless of `--no-redact`: that flag is documented
as disabling PATH/HOST/USER redaction, and no report has ever carried engine env
at all, so holding the line here regresses nothing.
