# test-bench-capture — guards for scripts/lib/capture.sh and bench.sh's capture layer.
#
# Extends the #835 mocked-scrape pattern: TIER 0 checks that can be made from the
# source text alone, TIER 1 unit tests of every scrape against fixture logs with
# the REAL line shapes, and TIER 1 end-to-end runs of the actual bench against the
# fake llama-server.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS FOR
#   The capture layer exists because a bench harness fails by printing a PLAUSIBLE
#   WRONG NUMBER, not by crashing. Every assertion below corresponds to a defect
#   that has actually shipped: a 0.00 TPS printed next to a healthy TTFT; a
#   cumulative hit rate that says a bigger pool is worse; an '[moe-cache] enabled:'
#   banner that hides a device with no pool (#824); a drafter reporting 0.992
#   acceptance while firing on a quarter of the requests.
#
# So: assert STRUCTURE, STATUS and WARNINGS — never a throughput value. Numbers
# from a fake server mean nothing.
#
# HERMETIC BY CONSTRUCTION — both are load-bearing:
#   SERVER_PID=<pid>           capture.sh otherwise runs `pgrep -x llama-server`
#                              and would adopt a production server's argv/env.
#   PREFLIGHT_NO_AUTODETECT=1  bench.sh otherwise adopts whatever container is up.
