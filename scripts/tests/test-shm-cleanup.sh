# test-shm-cleanup — scripts/lib/shm-cleanup.sh removes ONLY orphaned engine shared-memory segments,
# and switch.sh runs it before every boot.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
# --------------------
# With `ipc: host`, engine shared-memory segments live in the HOST /dev/shm and survive an unclean
# container stop; 65 GB had piled up on the reference rig by 2026-09-25 (vllm#57303 alone leaks the
# whole KV-offload RAM tier). The cleanup has to be aggressive enough to reclaim that and careful
# enough never to touch a segment something is still using. This runs the REAL helper against a
# scratch directory seeded with one file per rule and asserts exactly which ones it removes:
#   removed : root-owned, engine-named, old, unmapped (psm_* and vllm_offload_*.mmap)
#   kept    : too young; not root-owned; not an engine name; held open by a live process.
