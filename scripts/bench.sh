# Canonical bench against the running vLLM service.
#   - Runs both the canonical narrative AND code prompts in one invocation.
#     This matches the README's narrative/code TPS pairing.
#   - 3 warmup + N measured runs per prompt (default 5 narrative + 5 code).
#   - per-run: wall time, TTFT (via streaming), completion tokens,
#     wall_TPS (= comp / wall), decode_TPS (= comp / (wall - TTFT))
#   - per-prompt summary: mean / std / CV for both TPS metrics + mean TTFT
#     + prompt-processing throughput (`PP tok/s`)
#   - shows MTP SpecDecoding metrics from docker logs at the end
#
# Why two TPS metrics:
#   - wall_TPS  = "user-perceived speed" (includes prefill cost)
#   - decode_TPS = "model decode rate" (excludes prefill)
#   For long prompts the two can differ a lot. For short prompts they
#   converge. Reporting both keeps comparisons honest across configs.
#
# Why narrative + code:
#   MTP acceptance varies wildly by prompt structure. Code (repetitive,
#   token-predictable) accepts at ~80% per position; prose (semantically
#   rich) at ~50%. Reporting only one half is misleading. README claims
#   like "66 / 85 TPS" pair them; bench should too.
#
# Prereq: stack is running and reports "Application startup complete".
#
# Env vars:
#   URL                Endpoint. Default: http://localhost:8020
#   MODEL              Served model name. Default: auto-detected from
#                      /v1/models, else qwen3.6-27b
#   CONTAINER          Container for log scraping. Default: vllm-qwen36-27b
#   RUNS               Measured runs per prompt. Default: 5
#   WARMUPS            Warm-up runs (shared across both). Default: 3
#   PROMPT_NARR        Override narrative prompt
#   PROMPT_CODE        Override code prompt
#   MAX_TOKENS_NARR    Default: 1000
#   MAX_TOKENS_CODE    Default: 800
#   ONLY               Set to "narr" or "code" to skip the other. Default: both
#   QUIET              Set to 1 to skip per-run lines (just print summary)
#   PP                 Set to 1 to add the long-prompt PP fallback probe.
#                      llama.cpp containers enable this automatically.
#                      NOTE (#817): the `PP tok/s` line scraped from the ENGINE
#                      LOG is a ~10 s window average, and on the canonical ~15-tok
#                      prompts it is not a prefill rate at all — it rendered as
#                      `mean=2.00 CV=55.9%` and three community reports pasted it
#                      as data. It now prints only when it could be a rate
#                      (prompt >= 1000 tok, mean >= 50 tok/s, CV <= 100%) and is
#                      labelled `(engine log, windowed — indicative only)` when it
#                      does; otherwise it says n/a WITH THE REASON and points at
#                      the client-side `prefill tok/s`, which is trustworthy at
#                      CV 0.3-1.5%. Thresholds live in scripts/lib/capture.sh and
#                      are overridable via CAP_PP_MIN_PROMPT_TOKS /
#                      CAP_PP_MIN_TPS / CAP_PP_MAX_CV.
#   PP_FALLBACK_TOKENS Approximate filler-token target for PP=1. Default: 10000
#   PP_MAX_TOKENS      Completion cap for the PP fallback request. Default: 16
#   PREFILL_PROBE      Set to 0 to skip the canonical two-depth prefill/TTFT
#                      probe (catalog-baselines 2c). Default: 1. Each request
#                      uses a FRESH salted haystack — composes serve
#                      enable_prefix_caching, so identical prompts re-measure
#                      the CACHE HIT, not prefill. Depths exceeding the served
#                      context are skipped with a note.
#   PREFILL_DEPTHS     CSV of prompt-token depths. Default: 10000,90000 (the
#                      shallow/deep warm anchors; 90K sits inside the DeltaNet
#                      degradation regime and pairs with the verify-stress
#                      ladder's ~94K rung for anchor calibration).
#   PREFILL_RUNS       Measured runs per depth. Default: 3
#   ENABLE_THINKING    Set to 1 to send chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=true
#                      in bench requests. Default: 0.
#   FORCE_TOKENS       Force EXACTLY this many output tokens per run (sets
#                      max_tokens + min_tokens + ignore_eos), overriding
#                      MAX_TOKENS_NARR/CODE. Use to bench at a fixed / larger output
#                      size. Essential for DIFFUSION LMs: they self-terminate early
#                      (~1-2K words), so raising the cap alone won't lengthen the
#                      generation — you must force the length to measure sustained
#                      throughput. vLLM-oriented (ignore_eos/min_tokens). 0 = off
#                      (model decides length). Default: 0.
#   DECODE_GRANULARITY How this model emits tokens, which decides whether
#                      `decode_TPS` means anything at all (#809).
#                        auto   (default) classify from the measured runs
#                        token  autoregressive — decode_TPS is a decode rate
#                        canvas block diffusion (dLLM): the model denoises a whole
#                               canvas in parallel and the SSE endpoint emits ~one
#                               chunk per canvas, so TTFT == wall on any response
#                               that fits in one block and the decode window is
#                               zero-width. decode_TPS is NOT a decode rate for
#                               this class; the headline number is wall_TPS.
#   BENCH_DEGEN_WINDOW_FRAC
#                      A run whose decode window is below this fraction of its own
#                      wall time has no measurable decode rate and prints n/a
#                      rather than a number. Default: 0.05 — an AR decode window
#                      is ~the whole wall, so this sits ~20x away from any AR run
#                      and cannot fire on one.
#
# Capture knobs (the always-on capture layer — scripts/lib/capture.sh):
#   SERVER_LOG         Path to a BARE-METAL server log. CONTAINER=none runs used to
#                      report "log scrape unavailable" and every engine-side number
#                      had to be hand-extracted; point this at the file the server
#                      writes and the engine-side TPS, expert-cache and drafter
#                      captures all light up. Default: unset (docker log scrape,
#                      or nothing).
#   SERVER_PID         Pin the serving process for /proc inspection (argv fingerprint,
#                      moe-cache env, RSS, swap). Default: auto (`pgrep -x`).
#                      SERVER_PID=none disables /proc inspection entirely.
#   ENDPOINT           chat (default) drives /v1/chat/completions with the model's
#                      chat template applied — the historical bench behaviour, kept
#                      as the default so numbers stay comparable. ENDPOINT=completion
#                      drives raw /v1/completions with NO template, for base models
#                      and for isolating template overhead.
#   STREAM_CALIB       1 = run a ~3 s STREAM-triad RAM-bandwidth ceiling calibration
#                      on the idle box before the bench, so the derived miss-path
#                      demand can be stated as a fraction of what this host delivers.
#                      Default: 0 (opt-in — it costs 3 s and needs numpy).
#                      NOTE: the CONTENTION probe (co-running STREAM during decode)
#                      is deliberately NOT here — it perturbs the run by construction
#                      and belongs in a separate opt-in arm.
#   CAPTURE            0 = skip the whole capture layer (the pre-capture output
#                      shape, for a harness that parses it). Default: 1.
#   SHORT_EOS_FRAC     A run whose completion is below this fraction of max_tokens
#                      counts as a short-EOS run and is excluded from "n-usable".
#                      Chat-tuned models EOS early and silently degenerate a 5-run
#                      shape to n=1. Default: 0.25.
#
# Card rendering (docs/BENCH_CARD.md — default OFF; unset CARD leaves output
# byte-identical to a run without it):
#   CARD=snapshot      Render Template 1 (SNAPSHOT) as a fenced markdown block at
#                      the end of the run, filled from this run's own captures.
#                      Human judgement (verdict, "quiet box", config slug) stays an
#                      explicit <fill: …> placeholder — the renderer never guesses.
#   CARD=ab            Render Template 2 (A/B) against a previously saved run.
#     BASELINE=<path>    REQUIRED for CARD=ab: a saved bench.sh log (arm A). Parsing
#                        is strict — a log missing its fingerprint or summary blocks
#                        fails with "baseline unparseable: <why>" instead of half a
#                        delta. The run's own numbers are printed either way.
#     KNOB="<text>"      Names the thing under test. Fingerprint differences matching
#                        it are ATTRIBUTED to the knob; anything else marks the card
#                        CONFOUNDED at the top.
#     NOISE_BAND=<pct>   Override the band. Default: 2x the worst decode CV across
#                        both arms — and the card states which was used.
#     EXPECTATION="<t>"  Fills the pre-registered-expectation line (default "none").
#     BOOT_POLICY="<t>"  Fills the boot-policy line.
#   CARD_RECORD_OUT=<path>
#                      Debug seam: also write the in-process card record, so it can
#                      be diffed against the one parsed back out of the run's log.

#   --quick / QUICK=1  WARMUPS=1 RUNS=1 ONLY=narr PREFILL_PROBE=0 QUIET=1
#                      A preset over existing knobs; no new measurement code. For
#                      A/B sweeps where the canonical protocol dominates wall-clock
#                      and only a direction is needed. NOT CANONICAL: no CV, no code

  --quick    ${QUICK_PRESET[*]}
             1 warmup + 1 measured run, narrative only, no prefill probe.
             Directional signal for A/B sweeps. Equivalent to QUICK=1.

             NOT CANONICAL. It gives up:
               * the 4 other measured runs, so there is NO CV and no way to tell
                 a real delta from noise within the arm;
               * the code shape (MTP/drafter acceptance differs sharply between
                 prose and code — one half is not the pair);
               * both prefill depths, so no prefill/TTFT anchor at all.
             Single-run TPS is NOT comparable across boots, and the output is
             not a BENCHMARKS.md row. CARD rendering is refused under --quick.

             --quick removes WITHIN-boot samples. It does NOT remove the need
             for >=2 BOOTS per arm on any comparison that requires a reboot
             (-ub, -b, KV type, offload layout). Pool allocation on the
             CPU-offload MoE path swings ~20% between boots of a byte-identical
             config (4949 vs 3942 slots) and throughput tracked it (-12%); that
             flipped "22L is the best no-spec config" from first to last once
             the arm was confirmed at 2 reps.

# epsilon and printed `decode_TPS=690000000.00` as though it were a throughput
# (#822, real output from a 2x5090 diffusiongemma run).
#
# The guard is a RATIO, not an absolute threshold, and that is what makes it safe
# for AR models: a real AR decode window IS essentially the whole wall (TTFT is a
# few percent of it), so 5% sits ~20x away from any autoregressive run and cannot
# fire on one. When it does fire there is no decode rate to report — not a small
# one, not a large one — so the column prints n/a and the run is excluded from the
# decode statistics. wall_TPS is the honest number for such a run.

#                                 (`topo -p2p`)? A closed GeForce module refuses
#                                 it outright; the open modules can grant it.
#   layer 2  NCCL USE           — is the collective library configured to use
#                                 P2P (NCCL_P2P_*/NVLINK_MODE), or told not to?
#   layer 3  engine custom-AR   — did the ENGINE engage its own all-reduce
#                                 kernel? vLLM vetoes its custom AR at world>2
#                                 without NVLink even when layers 1-2 are ON
