# shm-cleanup.sh — remove ORPHANED engine shared-memory segments from the host /dev/shm before a boot.
#
# WHY: the club composes run with `ipc: host`, so the shared-memory segments vLLM / SGLang / PyTorch
# create (psm_*, sgl_*, sglang_*, torch_*, sem.mp-*, vllm_offload_*.mmap) live in the HOST /dev/shm
# and outlive any container that does not exit cleanly. /dev/shm is tmpfs: every orphan is RAM that
# never comes back until someone deletes it. On 2026-09-25 the reference rig had 65 GB resident with
# nothing running — 339 orphans since 09-18, including two 32 GiB KV-offload regions (vllm#57303).
#
# SAFETY — a file is removed only when ALL of these hold:
#   1. its name matches one of the engine patterns above;
#   2. it is owned by root (created inside a container — a user's own process owns its segments);
#   3. it is older than CLUB3090_SHM_MIN_AGE_MIN minutes (default 5), so a peer container in the middle
#      of creating-then-mapping a segment is never raced;
#   4. no live process on the host maps it or holds an fd on it (read from /proc in the host PID
#      namespace).
# The files are root-owned in the sticky /dev/shm, so deleting them needs root: this runs one short
# alpine container with --pid=host + SYS_PTRACE (to read other processes' /proc/<pid>/maps and fds).
#
# Best-effort by contract: it NEVER fails a boot. No docker, no image and no network to pull it all
# mean "skip with a one-line note". CLUB3090_SHM_CLEANUP=0 disables it.
#
# Usage: source it and call `club_shm_cleanup`, or run it directly.
#   CLUB3090_SHM_DIR           directory to clean (default /dev/shm; tests point it elsewhere)
#   CLUB3090_SHM_MIN_AGE_MIN   minimum age in minutes (default 5)
#   CLUB3090_SHM_IMAGE         helper image (default: the first LOCAL one of alpine:3.20, alpine:3,
#                              alpine:latest, busybox:latest; pulls alpine:3 only when none is present)
