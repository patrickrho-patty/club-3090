# test-comfyui-clone-pinned — services/comfyui/entrypoint.sh's clone_pinned must land a
# node on its pinned commit from whichever mirror still has it (club-3090#1394).
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
# --------------------
# The HiDream-O1 node's author deleted their GitHub account. The entrypoint cloned it
# with `git clone --depth 1 <dead url>` under `set -e`, so every FRESH ComfyUI install
# stopped at that line — and the maintainer rig never saw it, because its clone already
# existed. clone_pinned replaces that for gone-upstream nodes: pin a SHA, try mirrors in
# order, warn (not exit) if none has it.
#
# Offline: the "mirrors" are local bare repos (file:// URLs) plus a URL that does not
# exist. Every case runs the REAL function text extracted from the entrypoint, under the
# entrypoint's own `set -euo pipefail`.
#
# Contract:
#   1. fresh install: skips a dead mirror and one that lacks the SHA, lands on the SHA.
#   2. existing clone already at the SHA: NO network (every mirror dead) — a local patch
#      is reset away (so the entrypoint's patch step re-applies cleanly), HEAD stays.
#   3. existing SHALLOW clone at an OLDER commit, dead origin: moves to the SHA.
#   4. no mirror has it: returns 0 with a WARN — the rest of ComfyUI still boots.
#   5. a pre-existing non-git directory at the destination is never deleted.
