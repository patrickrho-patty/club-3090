# Pull the latest club-3090 stack and re-run setup. The one-shot upgrade path.
#
# What this does (in order):
#   1. Refuses to run on a dirty tree — commit or stash your local edits first.
#   2. Bails on a non-master branch (forks / contributors should pull manually).
#   3. git pull --ff-only origin master  (no merge commits, no rebase ambiguity)
#   4. bash scripts/setup.sh <model>     (re-fetches missing weights — idempotent,
#                                          fast on second run)
#   5. Tells you to restart whatever variant you had running.
#
# What this does NOT do:
#   - Pull the vLLM image (the SHA is pinned in compose; setup.sh's
#     instructions cover the docker pull when needed).
#   - Restart your container — that's a deliberate user action, in case you
#     want to A/B old vs new before bringing the new variant up.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/update.sh                    # uses default model (qwen3.6-27b)
#   bash scripts/update.sh qwen3.6-27b        # explicit
#   bash scripts/update.sh --dry-run          # show what would happen, change nothing
#   bash scripts/update.sh --force            # skip the "behind origin" check (re-runs setup anyway)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — already up-to-date or successfully updated
#   1 — dirty tree / wrong branch / missing dep / git pull failed / setup.sh failed
