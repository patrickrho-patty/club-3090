#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
# --------------------
# c3's default catalog view (and `switch.sh --list`) groups by model and keeps each model's slugs in
# REGISTRY order — there is no secondary sort. The ThinkingCap replicas (#1395) were registered
# topology-first (all dual tiers, then multi4, then multi8, vLLM before SGLang) while qwen3.8-27b is
# engine → tier family (max… then fast…) → topology, so the same 29 lanes read in a different order
# under each model. Fixed 2026-09-25 by reordering the registry; this keeps a future replica slug from
# landing out of place. Each pair maps a replica slug to its base twin by a slug-token swap; every
# replica slug must have a twin, and the replica sequence must equal the base sequence restricted
# to those twins.
