# One 3090 — what to run

For **one RTX 3090 (24 GB)**. Pick a slug from the table, launch it, and read the notes below
before you put an agent on it.

> 📣 **Newest first:** new slugs, numbers and caveats are posted in
> [Announcements](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/categories/announcements)

## Pick a slug

**Quick picks** (2026-09-23):
- **Long context + vision on one card:** `llamacpp/mimo9b-single-vision` (MiMo 9B, ⚠️) or
  `llamacpp/qwen38-27b-single-iq4xs` (Qwen3.8-27B on q4_0 KV, 🧪). Both serve the full 262,144 tokens
  with vision and leave a second card free.
- **Gemma:** `vllm/gemma-12b-single-int8-mtp` (full context) or `vllm/gemma-26ba4b-single` (176K).
- **Qwen3.6-27B** on one card is `vllm/minimal`: 32K, no vision. For long context on Qwen3.6, use two
  cards ([DUAL_CARD.md](DUAL_CARD.md)).
- ⚠️ The **NVFP4** slugs don't run on a 3090: they need Hopper/Blackwell (sm 9.0+), and
  `vllm/qwen38-27b-single-nvfp4` needs a 32 GB card.

14 slugs. ⭐ = the model's default for this topology (`bash scripts/switch.sh <model>/default`). Generated from the registry by `tools/docs/slug_tables.py`; don't edit by hand.

## Launch

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh <model>            # first time: downloads the weights
bash scripts/switch.sh <slug>            # ✅ / ⚠️ slugs
bash scripts/switch.sh --force <slug>    # 🧪 / 🐣 slugs
bash scripts/switch.sh --list            # what your machine can run (--all adds retired slugs)
```

New to this? [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) walks through the first run.

## Before you rely on it

- **Agents that keep their context** (Cline, OpenCode, Roo, hermes and similar): single-card vLLM on
  Qwen3.6-27B (`vllm/minimal`) hits a cliff at ~21–26K accumulated tokens
  ([Cliff 2b](CLIFFS.md)). It's specific to single-card vLLM on Qwen3-Next models; the llama.cpp slugs
  and Gemma don't have it. For long Qwen3.6 agent sessions, use two cards.
- **Idle VRAM isn't peak VRAM.** `nvidia-smi` at boot doesn't show the prefill peak (another
  0.5–1.5 GB). If a slug boots and then dies on the first long prompt, lower `MAX_MODEL_LEN`, or
  `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION` by 0.03.
- **Sharing the card with a desktop:** lower `MAX_MODEL_LEN` first; it's a clean KV cut.
  `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.80` is usually too low for vLLM's startup profiling.
- **Retired slugs still run.** `switch.sh --list --all` shows them and `--force` launches them,
  unmaintained. For example `llamacpp/default`: Qwen3.6-27B at 200K, immune to the cliff above.
