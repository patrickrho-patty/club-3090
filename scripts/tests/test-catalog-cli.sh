# Guard: scripts/catalog.sh is the front door to the LOCAL layer (#1202 P4).
#
# Pins the four properties that make it safe to hand a stranger:
#   1. an engine that cannot be inferred REFUSES and names the fix, rather than
#      writing engine="unknown" into the catalog — that user (their own engine
#      build) is precisely who the local layer exists for;
#   2. everything auto-filled is PRINTED before the write. A compose is read
#      mechanically and cannot know whether `-ts 1,1` is a layer split or tensor
#      parallelism in the catalog's sense, so a wrong value nobody saw is worse
#      than a prompt;
#   3. register -> unregister is a clean round trip in a throwaway root;
#   4. `unregister` cannot reach the curated catalog.

# 3b. THE OTHER ARCH SOURCE. Arch dims come from a GGUF header or an HF
# config.json, and the two are NOT interchangeable: gguf_facts_from_file does not
# return `attention_k_eq_v` while a config.json path can set it. Testing only the
# config.json leg passed while `--weights <model.gguf>` — the likelier path on a
# GGUF rig — refused every registration. Cover both, and SKIP LOUDLY rather than
# silently passing when this machine has no .gguf to read.
# Pick a MODEL gguf, not just any .gguf. The first hit on this rig was
# `mmproj-F16.gguf` — a multimodal projector with no arch dims — so the leg
# failed on a bad fixture while the code was correct. Done in ONE python call:
# the bash loop that did this was fragile under the test's quoting and silently
# selected nothing, which read as "no gguf on this machine".
