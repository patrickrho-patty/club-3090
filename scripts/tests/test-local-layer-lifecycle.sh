# END-TO-END lifecycle of a LOCAL-layer model: promote it, prove it is really
# registered, remove it, prove it is really gone.
#
# Why this exists: promote.py could add a local model, but nothing could remove
# one. Its docstring said the rollback was "delete the file(s)" — three of them,
# by hand, and MISSING THE REGISTRY ENTRY is the failure that bites: the files
# are gone while the merged registry still advertises the slug, so every
# launcher offers a config whose compose no longer exists. demote.py closes
# that, and this guard proves BOTH directions actually work rather than just
# exiting 0.
#
# Everything happens in a THROWAWAY root (mktemp -d). The real profiles-local/
# layer is never read or written — a test that promotes into the developer's own
# checkout would leave a slug behind on failure.
