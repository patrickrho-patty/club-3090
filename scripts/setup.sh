# What it does (per supported model):
#   - downloads model weights into $MODEL_DIR with SHA256 verification against
#     the hub's published x-linked-etag (no-redirect resolve HEAD via
#     scripts/lib/profiles/hf_fetch.py). A file the hub publishes no hash for is
#     reported UNVERIFIED and EXCLUDED from the verified count — "verified"
#     never attaches to a size-only check (#857)
#   - downloads the always-required drafter (Gemma 4: MTP "assistant"; Qwen3.6:
#     no always-required drafter — DFlash is optional via WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1;
#     Qwen3.8: DFlash2 optional via WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT=1 — REQUIRED by the 12
#     super*/ultra* slugs, so set it when serving those)
#
# Env vars (optional):
#   MODEL_DIR           Where to place model weights. Default: <repo>/models-cache
#   WEIGHTS             'autoround' (default, vLLM INT4) or 'gguf' (llama.cpp /
#                       ik_llama). gguf fetches the Q4_K_M MTP GGUF + mmproj for
#                       the llamacpp/* + ik-llama/* composes (qwen3.6-27b only).
#                       Use this if you're serving via llama.cpp/ik_llama rather than vLLM.
#   SKIP_MODEL          Set to 1 to skip the model download step
#   HF_TOKEN            HF token (public models, usually unnecessary)
#   WITH_ASSISTANT_DRAFT  Set to 1 to ALSO download the model's MTP "assistant"
#                       drafter when its profile registers one (setup:
#                       assistant_draft). Default: 0 — EXCEPT where the profile
#                       marks the drafter always_draft, in which case it is
#                       fetched unconditionally and this flag is redundant.
#                       ⚠️ vllm/gemma-26ba4b-single REQUIRES it: the slug
#                       defaults to SPEC_N=4, so without the drafter on disk
#                       vLLM aborts on a missing config.json. Either set this
#                       flag, or boot the slug drafter-less with SPEC_N=0.
#   WITH_DFLASH_DRAFT   Set to 1 to ALSO download the model family's DFlash
#                       drafter when one is registered in profiles/models/*.yml.
#                       Default: 0.
#                       Note: draft model is still under training as of
#                       2026-04-26; bench numbers in DUAL_CARD.md were
#                       measured against that snapshot. AL improvements
#                       expected when z-lab tags training-complete.
#   WITH_VISION         Set to 1 to ALSO download the F16 mmproj vision projector
#                       when the model registers one (qwen3.8-27b: the companion of
#                       the llamacpp/qwen38-27b-single-iq4xs slug, which ships
#                       q4/262K/vision). Default: 0. c3's Download pulls it via the
#                       slug's weights_companions regardless.
#   WITH_PRISM_EAGLE3   Set to 1 to ALSO download the Prism EAGLE3 drafter when
#                       the model registers one (setup: prism_eagle3).
#                       Default: 0.
#   HF_DOWNLOAD_RETRIES Attempts per repo download before giving up. Default: 4.
#                       A transfer is resumable, so a retry costs only the
#                       reconnect; raise it on a flaky link.
#   HF_DOWNLOAD_RETRY_SLEEP
#                       Seconds before the first retry, doubling up to 120.
#                       Default: 8.
#   PREFLIGHT_DISK_GB   Required free space at MODEL_DIR. Default: derived from
#                       the size_gb of every key this run would actually fetch
#                       (already-present weights cost nothing) + headroom.
#
# Idempotent: safe to re-run — skips steps already done.

#
#   1. The HEAD must NOT follow redirects. The old `curl -sfI` did, and on any
#      Xet-backed repo the 302 lands on the CAS bridge, whose response carries
#      the CAS *blob* ETag and NO `x-linked-etag` — so the canonical sha256,
#      which lives on the FIRST hop, read as "not published" on every modern
#      repo. The SKIP was the normal outcome, not a rare edge (#857).
#   2. One implementation means the downloader and setup.sh cannot disagree
#      about what "verified" means. They already did, and the weaker surface
#      was the one printing the reassuring line.
#
# Prints "<sha256|-> <size|->" and returns 0 when the hub answered at all;
# returns non-zero only when the lookup itself failed. A literal "-" in the hash
# field means the hub published NO sha256 for this file — the caller MUST treat
