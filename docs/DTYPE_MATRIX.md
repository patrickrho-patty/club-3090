# Hardware dtype & quant capability matrix

*Last verified: 2026-05-12. Kernel landscape moves fast — when in doubt, cross-check against the [vLLM nightly](https://docs.vllm.ai/), [Intel IPEX-LLM](https://github.com/intel-analytics/ipex-llm), [ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/), and the vendor arch docs cited at the bottom.*

What each GPU class accelerates *natively* in hardware vs *emulates* in software, across **NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD**. Use this as the input when picking KV-cache dtype, weight quant, and kernel path for a compose targeting a specific rig.

This stack ships **vLLM-CUDA-first** composes (NVIDIA), with **llama.cpp as the cross-vendor fallback** that runs on AMD (ROCm) and Intel (SYCL) too. The non-NVIDIA sections below are forward-looking — they tell you what's *hardware-supported* on those archs, with notes on which inference stack actually uses each path today.

# NVIDIA

> **TL;DR:**
> - **3090/A100 (Ampere)** → AutoRound/AWQ/GPTQ INT4 weights + BF16/INT8 compute + TQ3 KV. fp8 works but is software-emulated (no speedup vs fp16).
> - **4090/L40 (Ada)** → same as Ampere + native FP8 on Tensor Cores (lower throughput than Hopper but real).
> - **H100/H200 (Hopper)** → first arch with full FP8 transformer-engine path. Native FP8 weights + FP8 KV are the fast path.
> - **5090/5080 (Blackwell consumer)** → adds NVFP4 / FP4 / MXFP8 on top of Hopper's FP8.
> - **B100/B200 (Blackwell datacenter)** → same as consumer Blackwell plus enterprise features (TMA, SVE).

## At-a-glance — compute dtype support on Tensor Cores

✓ = native hardware Tensor Core support · 🟡 = software-emulated (correct but no speedup vs fp16) · ✗ = not supported · — = arch predates feature

| Compute dtype | Pascal (sm_60/61) | Volta (sm_70) | Turing (sm_75) | Ampere consumer (sm_86) | Ampere DC (sm_80) | Ada (sm_89) | Hopper (sm_90) | Blackwell DC (sm_10x) | Blackwell consumer (sm_120) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| FP32 (CUDA cores) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| TF32 (TC) | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP16 (TC) | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| BF16 (TC) | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT8 (TC) | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT4 (TC) | — | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP8 E4M3 / E5M2 (TC) | — | — | — | 🟡 SW | 🟡 SW | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP6 (TC) | — | — | — | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP4 / NVFP4 / MXFP4 (TC) | — | — | — | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| MXFP8 (TC) | — | — | — | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |

**The big inflection points:**

- **Turing (sm_75)** — first to add **INT8/INT4 Tensor Cores**. T4 was the data-center workhorse for INT8 inference for years. INT4 throughput on Turing is modest; the real volume push came one gen later.
- **Ampere (sm_80/86)** — adds **BF16** and **TF32** TCs. **Roughly 2× the INT8/INT4 throughput of Turing** + new **2:4 structured sparsity** path that doubles peak again on supported kernels. **No native FP8** (despite what some marketing suggested) — FP8 on Ampere is software-only and runs at ≤ fp16 speed. *(Note: TF32 here is a training/mixed-precision convenience format — it's rarely the active path during LLM inference, which generally runs in FP16/BF16/INT8/FP8 instead.)*
- **Ada (sm_89)** — first consumer arch with **native FP8 Tensor Cores** (E4M3 + E5M2). The 4090 / L40 get a real FP8 path. Peak FP8 TFLOPS is lower than Hopper's and — crucially — Ada **lacks Hopper's full transformer-engine integration** (faster on-die format conversion between FP8↔FP16, smarter mixed-precision accumulation, native FP8 KV). So Ada's FP8 is a real inference path but with a thinner kernel ecosystem than H100. Expect ~half the FP8 TFLOPS/clock of Hopper at comparable TC count.
- **Hopper (sm_90)** — first **transformer engine** with FP8 weights + FP8 KV both on-die, plus block-scaling support for higher-accuracy FP8 paths. The fast path for FP8 inference. H100 also adds TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator).
- **Blackwell (sm_10x DC / sm_120 consumer)** — adds **NVFP4 / FP4 / MXFP4** (4-bit float on TCs), **MXFP8**, and **FP6**. The first arch where 4-bit *compute* (not just storage) is a hardware feature. Genesis treats sm_10x and sm_120 as one family with the same FP8/FP4 hardware capabilities; performance per watt differs. *(Current vLLM nightlies on Blackwell still prefer FP8 paths in practice — NVFP4 kernels are landing but NVFP4-quantized weight artifacts for 27-31B models are scarce as of 2026-05. Expect FP8 → NVFP4 to be the next migration.)*

## Weight-quantization schemes — storage format vs compute path

Weight quants like AWQ / GPTQ / AutoRound are **storage formats**, not hardware features. The runtime kernel reads the quantized weights, dequantizes on-the-fly, and feeds Tensor Cores in a *different* compute dtype.

| Scheme | Storage | Compute on Ampere/Ada | Compute on Hopper+ | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FP16 (no quant) | FP16 | FP16 TC | FP16 TC | Baseline. Largest weight footprint. |
| BF16 (no quant) | BF16 | BF16 TC | BF16 TC | Same TC cost as FP16, larger numerical range. |
| GPTQ INT4 | INT4 + group scales | Marlin → FP16 TC | Marlin → FP16 TC | Layer-wise Hessian-based. Mature. |
| AWQ INT4 | INT4 + scales | Marlin → FP16 TC | Marlin → FP16 TC | Activation-aware salience scaling. |
| AutoRound INT4 ⭐ | INT4 + scales | Marlin → FP16 TC | Marlin → FP16 TC | Intel's signed-gradient quant. Strongest on Qwen-family per @Lorbus's recipes. |
| AutoRound INT8 | INT8 + scales | INT8 TC | INT8 TC | Less common; usually only for serving INT8 directly. |
| NF4 (NormalFloat4) | 4-bit float (normal-distribution optimized) | bitsandbytes kernels → FP16 TC | same | bitsandbytes / QLoRA path. Better accuracy than uniform INT4 on normally-distributed weights. Mostly used for **fine-tuning**, not inference. |
| SmoothQuant W8A8 | INT8 weights + INT8 activations + per-channel scales | INT8 TC (full path) | INT8/FP8 TC | Smooths activation outliers via per-channel scaling, enabling W8A8. **Weight + activation quant** — needs strong INT8/FP8 hardware. |
| FP8 weights (FBGEMM / INC) | FP8 | 🟡 SW → FP16 TC | FP8 TC | Native fast path only on Ada/Hopper/Blackwell. |
| MXFP8 weights | FP8 + per-32-element E8M0 block scale | ✗ no native path | ✗ no native path | OCP microscaling standard. Native on Blackwell only. |
| MXFP4 weights | FP4 + per-32-element E8M0 block scale | ✗ | ✗ | Blackwell-native. OCP community format. |
| NVFP4 weights | E2M1 (4-bit) + per-16-element E4M3 scale + optional global scale | ✗ | ✗ | NVIDIA-proprietary 4-bit format. Native on Blackwell (sm_10x + sm_120). Smaller scaling blocks than MXFP4 → typically better accuracy. |
| GGUF (Q4_0 / Q4_K_M / Q5_K_M / IQ4_XS / Q8_0 / …) | 4-8 bit mixed, llama.cpp's grouped/importance-aware variants | llama.cpp's own kernels → FP16 TC | same | Runs on any arch with FP16 TC support. K-quants use grouped blocks; IQ-quants are importance-aware. |
| HQQ / AQLM / SqueezeLLM | 2-4 bit, codebook or outlier-aware | software kernels | software kernels | Niche / research-grade. Less universal hardware path. |

**Key takeaway for Ampere users**: INT4 *weight* quant (AutoRound / AWQ / GPTQ) compute paths all converge through Marlin → FP16 TC on Ampere. The choice of *which* INT4 scheme is about **calibration quality**, not hardware acceleration. NF4, NVFP4, and MXFP4 require newer hardware (NF4 = bitsandbytes software, NVFP4/MXFP4 = Blackwell-only).

### Weight-only vs weight + activation quantization

This is a second axis on top of the storage format — *what* gets quantized:

| Axis | Weight-only (W*A16 / W*A8) | Weight + activation (W8A8 / W4A8) |
|---|---|---|
| What's quantized | Just the weights, activations stay FP16/BF16 | Both weights and activations are low-precision |
| Hardware needed | Any Tensor-Core-capable arch (Marlin dequants → FP16 compute) | Strong INT8/FP8 TCs needed for full speed |
| Best on | Ampere+ (universal) | Hopper+ (FP8) or Ada (FP8 with caveats) |
| Examples | AutoRound INT4, AWQ, GPTQ, NF4, FP8 W8A16 | SmoothQuant W8A8, INT8 W8A8, FP8 W8A8, NVFP4 W4A4 |
| Trade | Easier — broad compat. Activation tensors stay full-precision so accuracy is mostly preserved. | Harder — activations are harder to quantize cleanly (outliers). Bigger throughput wins when it works. |

For a 24 GB consumer-Ampere rig (this stack's primary target), weight-only INT4 (AutoRound / AWQ / GPTQ) is the sweet spot: best accuracy retention, no special hardware needed. Weight+activation paths are mostly a Hopper/Blackwell-and-up game today.

---

## KV-cache dtype support

KV cache is a separate concern from weights — vLLM ships several KV-quant schemes, most of which are software-only and work on any arch where vLLM runs.

| KV format | Implementation | Native HW? | Works on Ampere? | Notes |
|---|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| FP16 / BF16 | Standard cast | ✓ (FP16/BF16 TC) | ✓ | Baseline. Largest KV pool footprint. |
| FP8 (E4M3 / E5M2) | Software cast on Ampere; HW TC on Ada+ | partial | ✓ (SW) | Half the bytes/token vs FP16. The default in `dual/autoround-int4/fp8-mtp.yml`. |
| INT8 PTH (per-token-head) | Custom kernel with per-(token, head) scales | ✓ (INT8 TC) | ✓ | High single-stream TPS; **doesn't scale at concurrency** (see [FAQ](FAQ.md#int8-pth-gives-me-150-tps-single-stream-but-doesnt-scale-with-concurrency--is-that-a-bug)). |
| TurboQuant 3-bit (TQ3) | Custom Triton kernels | ✗ (Triton soft) | ✓ | ~5× the KV pool of FP16. Hybrid-attention models (Qwen3-Next) need a multi-query verify kernel for spec-decode (only Genesis P67 today). |
| TurboQuant 4-bit (TQ4) | Custom Triton kernels | ✗ | ✓ | ~4× the KV pool of FP16. Slightly higher quality than TQ3. |
| TurboQuant k8v4 | 8-bit K + 4-bit V mixed | ✗ | ✓ | Asymmetric — K matters more for attention precision. BF16-equivalent quality per the TQ paper. |

**Ada / Hopper / Blackwell get a real win on FP8 KV** because the Tensor Cores can multiply FP8 directly without an upcast. On Ampere, FP8 KV is just smaller storage — the matmul still happens in FP16, so you save VRAM but not compute time. That's why the 3090's fp8 KV gives lower per-stream TPS than INT8 PTH (which *can* multiply in INT8 on the Tensor Core directly).

**Emerging KV recipes** (worth watching, not yet defaults):
- **Block-scaled FP8 KV** — per-block scales like MXFP8 but applied to KV cache rather than weights. Recovers accuracy at long-context where flat FP8 can lose precision in deep layers. Lands on Hopper / Blackwell first.
- **NVFP4 KV** — Blackwell-native, ~4× smaller than FP16 KV at NVFP4 weight accuracy levels. Kernels still maturing in vLLM nightlies.
- **TensorRT-LLM W4A8 / W4A4** — Hopper/Blackwell weight+activation quant recipes that pair INT4/NVFP4 weights with FP8/FP4 activations. Out of scope for the vLLM-first composes here but worth knowing if you cross-shop.

# Intel

Intel's Tensor-Core equivalent is **XMX (Xe Matrix Extensions)** on Xe-architecture GPUs. The lineage from old to new:

- **Xe-HPG (Arc A-series — Alchemist, 2023)** — first consumer XMX. INT8/INT4/FP16/BF16 supported. No FP8.
- **Xe-HPC / Ponte Vecchio (Flex Series, Max 1100/1550, datacenter)** — high-density XMX. INT8/INT4/FP16/BF16. No FP8 in original silicon.
- **Xe2 (Arc B-series — Battlemage, Lunar Lake iGPU, 2025)** — XMX gen-2. Adds **INT2** support, ~2× INT8 throughput vs Alchemist, partial FP8 emerging. MXFP4 / microscaling formats landing via OpenVINO.

## Intel XMX feature matrix

| Format | Xe-HPG (Arc A) | Xe-HPC (Flex/Max DC) | Xe2 (Arc B / Lunar Lake iGPU) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| FP32 (vector) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP16 (XMX) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| BF16 (XMX) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT8 (XMX) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (~2× HPG throughput) |
| INT4 (XMX) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT2 (XMX) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| FP8 E4M3 / E5M2 | ✗ | ✗ | 🟡 partial (silicon support; production stacks maturing) |
| MXFP4 / microscaling | ✗ | ✗ | 🟡 emerging via OpenVINO |
| FP4 / NVFP4 | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

**FP8 maturity caveat (mid-2026)**: Xe2 silicon supports FP8, but **full FP8 acceleration in production inference stacks (vLLM-SYCL, IPEX-LLM)** is still being plumbed through. OpenVINO has the most coverage today; expect 6-12 month lag behind NVIDIA's transformer-engine path for equivalent throughput. Track [oneAPI release notes](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/overview.html) for kernel landing dates.

## Intel KV cache options

| KV format | Xe-HPG (Arc A) | Xe-HPC (DC) | Xe2 (Arc B) | Stack |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| FP16 / BF16 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | universal — IPEX-LLM / OpenVINO default |
| INT8 via XMX | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | IPEX-LLM has the most coverage |
| FP8 | ✗ | ✗ | 🟡 emerging | not production-ready in vLLM-SYCL as of 2026-05 |
| llama.cpp `q4_0` / `q5_0` / `q8_0` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | SYCL backend — most portable path on Intel GPUs today |

## What this means for LLM serving on Intel

| GPU class | Best path today | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| Arc A-series (A770 16 GB / A580 / A380) | GPTQ/AWQ INT4 + FP16 compute | llama.cpp via SYCL backend; IPEX-LLM for transformer-style serving; OpenVINO for batch-low-latency |
| Arc B-series (Battlemage B580 / B570) | Same as A + INT4/INT8 throughput uplift; FP8 paths landing | Same stacks, Xe2-tuned kernels |
| Max Series / Flex (data center) | INT8 with sparsity; some BF16 / FP16 mixed | OpenVINO + oneAPI |

**Key strengths**: cost-effective low-bit inference (INT4/INT8). Arc A770 16 GB has been a popular budget cross-vendor option for small LLMs via llama.cpp.

**Key weaknesses**: ecosystem maturity. FP8 kernels are still landing; vLLM has a SYCL backend but it's significantly less mature than the CUDA path; advanced quants like NVFP4 / MXFP4 are mostly research at this point.

**For club-3090 composes**: Intel users today go through **llama.cpp** (`ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-intel` image or build with SYCL). The KV-quant menu shrinks to llama.cpp's offerings (`q4_0`, `q5_0`, `q8_0`); spec-decode menu shrinks to llama.cpp's MTP PR and ngram.

# AMD

AMD splits matrix acceleration across two distinct architecture lines:

- **RDNA (Radeon consumer)** — uses **WMMA** (Wave Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) instructions
- **CDNA (Instinct datacenter)** — uses **MFMA** (Matrix Fused Multiply-Add) — much denser; the actual AMD AI silicon

The two are *not* the same hardware path and have very different LLM-serving characteristics.

## RDNA (Radeon consumer) — WMMA

| Format | RDNA 2 (RX 6000) | RDNA 3 (RX 7000) | RDNA 4 (RX 8000 / RX 9000) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| FP32 (vector) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP16 (WMMA) | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| BF16 (WMMA) | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT8 (WMMA) | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT4 (WMMA) | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP8 E4M3 / E5M2 (WMMA) | — | 🟡 limited | ✓ native |
| 2:4 structured sparsity | — | — | ✓ |

**RDNA 3 (RX 7900 XTX / 7900 XT / 7800 XT / 7700 XT)** — first WMMA generation. FP16/BF16/INT8/INT4 work; FP8 path is limited and depends on kernel availability.

**RDNA 4 (RX 8000 / RX 9000 series, 2025+)** — WMMA gen-3. Early roadmaps used the RX 8000 name; AMD officially shipped under the RX 9000 brand. Adds **native FP8** (E4M3 + E5M2), **2:4 structured sparsity** (effectively doubling peak TFLOPS on supported kernels), and improved INT4/INT8 throughput. The first consumer Radeon arch that's seriously competitive for LLM inference.

## CDNA (Instinct datacenter) — MFMA

| Format | CDNA 2 (MI250/MI210) | CDNA 3 (MI300X/MI300A) | CDNA 4 (MI350/MI400) |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| FP16 (MFMA) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| BF16 (MFMA) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT8 (MFMA) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| INT4 (MFMA) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP8 E4M3 / E5M2 (MFMA) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| FP6 (MFMA) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| FP4 / MXFP4 / NVFP4-style (MFMA) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| MXFP8 (MFMA) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| 2:4 structured sparsity | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |

**CDNA 3 (MI300X)** — AMD's Hopper competitor. 192 GB HBM3 per card, FP8 MFMA. Massive memory + competitive FP8 throughput; the option to look at if you want to escape NVIDIA's data-center pricing.

**CDNA 4 (MI350 / MI400)** — AMD's Blackwell competitor. Adds FP6 / FP4 / MXFP* native paths. **Note: NVFP4 specifically is NVIDIA-proprietary (E2M1 data + per-16-element E4M3 scaling)** and AMD doesn't support it. What AMD supports on CDNA 4 are the *OCP-standard* block-scaled FP4/FP6 formats (per-32-element E8M0 scales — MXFP4 / MXFP6) plus AMD-defined variants. For cross-vendor portability the safer 4-bit target is MXFP4; NVFP4 is a NVIDIA-only optimization.

## AMD KV cache options

| KV format | RDNA 3 (RX 7000) | RDNA 4 (RX 8000/9000) | CDNA 2 (MI200) | CDNA 3 (MI300) | CDNA 4 (MI350+) | Stack |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| FP16 / BF16 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | universal — vLLM ROCm / llama.cpp |
| FP8 | ✗ | ✓ native | ✗ | ✓ native | ✓ native | vLLM ROCm on CDNA 3+ / RDNA 4 |
| INT8 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | quant scheme dependent |
| MXFP* block-scaled | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | 🟡 emerging | ✓ | AMD's NVFP4 equivalent; Composable Kernel landing |
| llama.cpp `q4_0` / `q5_0` / `q8_0` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ROCm backend — most portable on consumer Radeon |

## What this means for LLM serving on AMD

| GPU class | Best path today | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| RDNA 3 (RX 7900 XTX 24 GB) | GPTQ/AWQ INT4 + FP16 compute via ROCm | llama.cpp ROCm image (`ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-rocm`); vLLM ROCm (improving) |
| RDNA 4 (RX 9000) | Add FP8 paths + 2:4 sparsity | Same stacks, RDNA4-tuned kernels landing in 2025-26 |
| CDNA 3 (MI300X) | **FP8 weights + FP8 KV** | vLLM ROCm fork; AMD's Composable Kernel; production-grade |
| CDNA 4 (MI350+) | FP4 / MXFP4 / FP6 paths emerging | vLLM ROCm + AMD ML libs |

**Key strengths**: huge HBM on Instinct (192 GB on MI300X — a single card holds models that need TP=4 on H100s); RDNA 4 brings consumer FP8 to AMD for the first time.

**Key weaknesses**: software fragmentation between ROCm (datacenter-quality) and consumer Radeon drivers; fewer production-grade quant kernels than NVIDIA's ecosystem; vLLM's ROCm backend is real but trails CUDA in feature parity (no DFlash on AMD, fewer KV-quant formats, etc.).

**For club-3090 composes**: AMD users today go through **llama.cpp** for consumer Radeon (`ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server-rocm`), or **vLLM ROCm** for Instinct rigs. If you have an MI300X, the relevant comparisons are against H100, not against this stack's 3090 baseline.

# Cross-vendor routing

When future composes want to detect the host GPU and pick an optimal path, here's the rough decision tree:

```
1. Detect vendor + arch
   - NVIDIA: torch.cuda.is_available() and torch.version.hip is None
             → torch.cuda.get_device_capability()  →  (major, minor)
   - AMD:    torch.cuda.is_available() and torch.version.hip is not None
             → torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).gcnArchName  →  e.g. "gfx1100" (RDNA3)
             → confirm via `rocm-smi --showproductname` or env $ROCM_PATH
             ⚠ HIP-via-PyTorch appears as `cuda` — distinguish via torch.version.hip, NOT torch.cuda
   - Intel:  torch.xpu.is_available()  →  sycl device query, parse arch via clinfo or sycl-ls
   - Apple:  torch.backends.mps.is_available()  (out of scope for these composes)

2. Map to capability tier
   - NVIDIA sm_120 / sm_10x   → Blackwell tier (FP4 / NVFP4 / MXFP* available)
   - NVIDIA sm_90              → Hopper tier (FP8 + transformer engine)
   - NVIDIA sm_89              → Ada tier (FP8 native, thinner kernel set)
   - NVIDIA sm_80 / sm_86      → Ampere tier (BF16/INT8, FP8 emulated)
   - AMD CDNA 4                → MI350+ tier (FP4/FP6/MXFP*)
   - AMD CDNA 3                → MI300X tier (FP8 + huge HBM)
   - AMD RDNA 4                → RX 9000 tier (FP8 consumer)
   - AMD RDNA 3                → RX 7000 tier (INT8/INT4 only)
   - Intel Xe2                 → Battlemage tier (INT2/INT4/INT8 + emerging FP8)
   - Intel Xe-HPG              → Alchemist tier (INT4/INT8/FP16)

3. Pick KV + weight quant per tier
   - Blackwell  → NVFP4 weights (when artifact exists) or FP8 weights + FP8 KV
   - Hopper     → FP8 weights + FP8 KV
   - Ada        → AutoRound INT4 weights + FP8 KV
   - Ampere     → AutoRound INT4 weights + TQ3 / INT8 PTH / fp8 KV
   - CDNA 4     → MXFP4 / FP8 weights + FP8 KV
   - CDNA 3     → FP8 weights + FP8 KV
   - RDNA 4     → AWQ/GPTQ INT4 + FP8 KV
   - RDNA 3     → AWQ/GPTQ INT4 + FP16 KV (no FP8)
   - Xe2        → AWQ/GPTQ INT4 + FP16 KV (FP8 in progress)
   - Xe-HPG     → AWQ/GPTQ INT4 + FP16 KV

4. Pick engine
   - vLLM-CUDA      for NVIDIA Ampere+
   - vLLM-ROCm      for AMD Instinct (CDNA)
   - llama.cpp-ROCm for AMD consumer (RDNA)
   - llama.cpp-SYCL for Intel
   - llama.cpp-CPU  fallback (anywhere)
```

This stack codifies the NVIDIA half of that tree today via `scripts/switch.sh` + the `models/<model>/<engine>/compose/` tree. Cross-vendor routing is a future-direction item — happy to entertain PRs that add `compose/intel/` or `compose/amd/` paths once we have benchmark numbers from those rigs to ground them in.

**Ecosystem maturity caveat (mid-2026)**: NVIDIA's stack (vLLM + Marlin + Genesis + TensorRT-LLM + cuDNN) has 2-3 years more polish than AMD ROCm or Intel oneAPI. Expect day-zero kernel coverage on NVIDIA for new model architectures, and 1-3 month lag on AMD/Intel for the same models to reach equivalent throughput. For mission-critical inference, NVIDIA stays the default; for cost-sensitive or vendor-diversification scenarios, the Instinct (MI300X+) and Battlemage paths are increasingly viable.

## Per-arch recommendations for club-3090 composes

What to ship as the default for each GPU class, given the matrix above:

| GPU class | Best weight quant | Best KV dtype | Best spec-decode | Compose pattern |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pascal (10x0)** | FP16 only — no INT8 TC | FP16 | none (vLLM unsupported, CC<7.5) | llama.cpp only |
| **Volta (V100)** | FP16 — no BF16 TC, weak INT8 | FP16 | none | llama.cpp — see [@efschu's V100 bench](../BENCHMARKS.md#qwen36-27b) |
| **Turing (T4, 20-series)** | INT8 native; GPTQ INT4 via Marlin works | FP16 / INT8 | n-gram only | not a primary target |
| **Ampere consumer (3090/3080/3060)** ⭐ | **AutoRound INT4** | **TQ3 (Genesis) / INT8 PTH / fp8** | **MTP n=3** + Genesis P67 | `dual/autoround-int4/turbo.yml`, `dual/autoround-int4/tq3-mtp-genesis.yml`, `single/autoround-int4/long-text.yml` — primary target of this stack |
| **Ampere DC (A100)** | AutoRound INT4 or FP16 | TQ3 / fp8 | MTP n=3 | Same composes as 3090, more VRAM headroom |
| **Ada (4090 / L40)** | AutoRound INT4 (preserve INT4 path) **OR** FP8 weights for full TC use | **fp8 (HW)** / TQ3 / INT8 PTH | MTP n=3 / DFlash | Same composes work; FP8 KV is now a real perf win |
| **Hopper (H100/H200)** | FP8 weights (FBGEMM/INC) | **fp8 (HW transformer engine)** | MTP / DFlash | Not a primary target — these cards are usually already running their own optimised stacks |
| **Blackwell consumer (5090/5080/5070)** | AutoRound INT4 today; NVFP4 when vLLM kernels mature | fp8_e5m2 advisory (e4m3 path undertuned per #51) | MTP n=3 | Genesis treats Blackwell consumer as a separate regime — some Hopper-targeted patches don't apply |
| **Blackwell DC (B100/B200/GB200)** | NVFP4 / FP8 weights | NVFP4 / fp8 | MTP / DFlash | Out of scope for club-3090 |

The starred row (Ampere consumer) is the actual target of this stack; everything else is "should work, here's the data point we have".

## How to detect your GPU's capabilities at runtime

The Genesis patch stack already encodes most of this — the guard functions in `models/qwen3.6-27b/vllm/patches/genesis/vllm/_genesis/guards.py` give you the runtime answer:

```python
import vllm._genesis.guards as g

g.get_compute_capability()    # → (8, 6) on 3090, (8, 9) on 4090, (9, 0) on H100, (12, 0) on 5090, (10, 0) on B200
g.is_ampere_consumer()         # 3090/3080/...
g.is_ampere_datacenter()       # A100
g.is_ada_lovelace()            # 4090/L40
g.is_hopper()                  # H100/H200 — exactly sm_90
g.is_blackwell()               # any sm_10x or sm_120
g.is_blackwell_datacenter()    # B100/B200/GB200 — sm_10x
g.is_blackwell_consumer()      # 5090/5080/5070 — sm_120
g.has_native_fp8()             # True on Ada+ (sm_89+)
```

For the same info outside Python, `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap --format=csv,noheader` returns `8.6` / `8.9` / `9.0` / `12.0` etc.

## Notes on the corner cases

**FP8 on Ada vs Hopper.** Both have FP8 Tensor Cores. The numerical formats (E4M3 + E5M2) are the same. The difference is peak throughput: Hopper's transformer engine has higher FP8 TFLOPS/clock and on-die format-conversion units that Ada doesn't. For Qwen3.6-27B inference, the practical difference between Ada and Hopper FP8 KV is in the single-digit-% range — both are real hardware paths, both meaningfully faster than Ampere's software emulation.

**Blackwell consumer vs Blackwell datacenter.** Genesis treats them as one family for has_native_fp8 / has_native_fp4 purposes, but different regimes for kernel tuning. Per club-3090#51 (apnar 2026-05-04): fp8_e4m3 + 96K ctx on RTX 5090 regressed 2-6% TPS vs fp8_e5m2 + 48K — vLLM's Blackwell e4m3 codepath is newly added and undertuned. Use e5m2 on consumer Blackwell until the pin catches up. Sm_120 also surfaced a `CUDAGraphMode.FULL_AND_PIECEWISE not supported with spec-decode for FlashInferBackend` issue — Genesis ships P100 patch (PR #41127 backport) for this.

**NVFP4 on RTX 5090 today.** The hardware supports it. vLLM's NVFP4 quant kernels are landing in 2026-05/06 nightlies but aren't broadly used yet — most public 27-31B weight artifacts are still INT4 (AutoRound/AWQ/GPTQ), not NVFP4. Once NVFP4-quantized weight artifacts ship for Qwen3.6 / Gemma 4 / etc., Blackwell consumer rigs gain a meaningful TPS lift on top of FP8.

**NVFP4 vs MXFP4 — same bit-width, different block size.** Both are 4-bit float formats Blackwell accelerates natively. They differ in how often the scale changes:

| | NVFP4 (NVIDIA) | MXFP4 (OCP / community) |
|---|---|---|
| Element format | E2M1 (4-bit) | E2M1 (4-bit) |
| Scale block size | **16 elements** | **32 elements** |
| Scale format | E4M3 (8-bit) per block + optional global FP32 | E8M0 (8-bit exponent only) per block |
| Implication | Finer-grained scaling → typically better accuracy | Coarser scaling → slightly larger throughput, slightly worse accuracy |
| Vendor support | NVIDIA-proprietary, Blackwell-native | Open standard from OCP — supported across Blackwell + future AMD MI3xx/MI4xx |

For inference workloads, NVFP4 is usually preferred when both are available. MXFP4 wins on cross-vendor portability.

**MXFP* (microscaling) family.** The OCP microscaling standard adds **per-32-element block scales** (E8M0 = 8-bit power-of-two scale) on top of FP4 / FP6 / FP8 element formats: **MXFP4 / MXFP6 / MXFP8**. Native on Blackwell Tensor Cores; emulation possible on older arches but slow. The block-scale trick lets you keep low-bit element storage while recovering most of the dynamic range you'd lose with plain low-bit floats — so MXFP* formats typically score **measurably better on perplexity / downstream accuracy than plain low-bit floats at the same bit width**, which is exactly why Blackwell hardware leans into them. Expect MXFP8 to be the new "FP8 with better accuracy" default once kernel paths mature.

**FP6 on Blackwell.** Blackwell adds native FP6 Tensor Cores — same theoretical throughput as FP8, smaller storage. Useful middle-ground between FP8 (highest accuracy at low precision) and FP4 (highest density). Kernel ecosystem is still maturing; not yet a common production choice for LLM serving as of 2026-05.

**INT4 Tensor Cores.** All Turing+ archs have INT4 TCs in hardware — but they're almost never used as compute targets. Most "INT4 weights" workloads (AWQ/GPTQ/AutoRound) dequant the INT4 weights to FP16 on the fly and use the FP16 TCs. Marlin is the canonical kernel for this; Machete is a newer alternative. Direct INT4 TC compute is mainly a special-case path inside CUTLASS / cuBLASLt and not how most LLM inference works today.

**INT8 KV PTH anti-scaling.** Per-token-head INT8 stores a separate scale per (token, head) pair. Single-stream is fast (the scale lookup is cheap), but at concurrency the per-(token, head) dequant becomes a serialization point. fp8 has a single global scale and scales near-linearly. See [FAQ](FAQ.md#int8-pth-gives-me-150-tps-single-stream-but-doesnt-scale-with-concurrency--is-that-a-bug).
