# Quality-test wrapper around `benchlocal-cli` — measures behavioral quality
# (tool-call correctness, instruction-following, structured output, etc) of
# the running compose. Sits in the test pipeline between bench.sh and
# soak-test.sh:
#
#   verify.sh         — fast smoke ("does it serve")
#   verify-full.sh    — functional ("does everything work")
#   verify-stress.sh  — boundary ("does it survive stress")
#   bench.sh          — throughput ("what's the TPS")
#   quality-test.sh   — behavioral ("does it produce useful output")  ← THIS
#   soak-test.sh      — stability ("does it stay healthy over time")
#
# Catches what the operational tests miss: a compose can pass all 5 layers
# of operational testing and still ship with degraded tool-call accuracy or
# instruction-follow drift from quantization or Genesis env-var changes.
#
# Reference: docs/QUALITY_TEST.md
#
# Prereq: benchlocal-cli installed (see "Install" below) + a running compose.

quality-test.sh — behavioral quality bench against a running compose

USAGE
  bash scripts/quality-test.sh [MODE | --pack PACK_ID] [OPTIONS]

MODES
  --quick    2 packs:  toolcall-15, instructfollow-15
             ~5-10 min, no Docker required
  --medium   5 packs:  + structoutput-15, dataextract-15, reasonmath-15  (DEFAULT)
             ~15-25 min, no Docker required
  --full     8 packs:  + bugfind-15, hermesagent-20, cli-40
             ~25-40 min, requires Docker (auto-starts sandbox containers)
  --reasoning
             Reasoning suite: humaneval-plus-30, lcb-v6-30, gpqa-diamond
             metadata gate, gsm-symbolic-30. Separate from --full; code
             packs require Docker.

  --pack PACK_ID   Run a single pack (overrides mode flag).
                   Available IDs:
                     toolcall-15  instructfollow-15  structoutput-15
                     dataextract-15  reasonmath-15
                     bugfind-15  cli-40  hermesagent-20  (require Docker)
  --scenario P/S   Run one pack-qualified scenario, e.g. cli-40/CLI-31 (repeatable;
                   intersects with --pack / mode when one is given, else the pack
                   set is derived from the selection).
  --scenarios-file F
                   Newline-delimited PACK_ID/SCENARIO_ID selections (# comments OK).
                   Curated probe sets live in scripts/scenario-sets/.
                   ⚠ Selection results are PARTIAL — labeled in the JSON
                   (selection + catalog_scenario_count) and never a /150 claim;
                   history ingestion and rescore refuse them without --allow-partial.
  --incremental    Journal each scored scenario to <save-json>.partial.jsonl
                   (fsynced) so an interrupted run is inspectable and resumable.
  --resume PATH    Resume a result.json or .partial.jsonl: restores the original
                   pack-set/selection/thinking/sampling/timeout config and runs
                   only the missing scenario/repeat arms. Mutually exclusive with
                   mode/--pack/--scenario/thinking/sampling/timeout flags.
  --allow-partial  Permit a partial (selection) result into --history-file / rescore.
                     humaneval-plus-30  lcb-v6-30  gsm-symbolic-30
                     gpqa-diamond  (gated metadata-only until access approved)

OPTIONS
  -h, --help       Show this help and exit
  --list-packs     List available packs and exit
  --no-sandboxed   On --full, skip the Docker sandbox packs (= --medium scope)
  --sandboxed-only Run only the 3 sandbox packs (bugfind-15, cli-40, hermesagent-20).
                   Skips the deterministic packs — useful when iterating on
                   sandbox verifiers without paying the deterministic-pack cost.

OPTIONS (extra)
  --model NAME     Pin the served-model-name. When set (here or via MODEL env),
                   we use YOUR value and never override it from /v1/models —
                   required for llama-swap / multi-model endpoints where
                   /v1/models returns the first (often wrong) registered model.
  --timeout-per-case N
                   Pass through to benchlocal-cli as --timeout-per-case N
                   (seconds). When NOT set, benchlocal-cli uses per-pack
                   metadata defaults (60s for the deterministic packs, 300s
                   for cli-40 / hermesagent-20, 1800s for aider-polyglot-30;
                   see benchlocal-cli #41). Set this only to override.
  --sandbox-log-dir DIR
                   Capture each sandboxed pack's container log to
                   DIR/sandbox-<pack_id>.log before teardown (forwarded to
                   benchlocal-cli). Without it, sandbox logs are lost on
                   container cleanup. Also settable via SANDBOX_LOG_DIR env.
  --progress / --no-progress
                   Toggle benchlocal-cli's per-scenario `[N/M]` live progress
                   to stderr. **Default ON** — long quality runs (--full,
                   --reasoning, --pack aider-polyglot-30, --pack cli-40) go
                   dark for 10-60 min without it, with no signal whether
                   anything is wrong mid-run. Pass --no-progress for CI / when
                   stderr volume matters. Also settable via PROGRESS=0/1 env.
  --sampling-from-server
                   Inherit sampling from the serving config instead of using
                   the pack's default temp=0. Omits sampling params from
                   requests so the server applies its own defaults (llama.cpp
                   --temp, vLLM --override-generation-config). Reads back via
                   GET /props and records the values. Tags the run as
                   non-canonical. Also settable via SAMPLING_FROM_SERVER=1 env.
  --enable-thinking
                   Forward to benchlocal-cli --enable-thinking so reasoning
                   models are evaluated with request-level thinking enabled
                   for every pack (overrides each pack's default_thinking).
                   Also settable via ENABLE_THINKING=1 env.
  --no-thinking
                   Forward to benchlocal-cli --no-thinking — force thinking
                   OFF for every pack, ignoring per-pack default_thinking
                   (the packs that default thinking-on: instructfollow-15,
                   reasonmath-15, bugfind-15, hermesagent-20 — plus the
                   --reasoning suite). Mutually exclusive with --enable-thinking.
                   Use for a clean all-off arm of a reasoning A/B. Also
                   settable via NO_THINKING=1 env.
                   All four degrade gracefully: across 150 saved hermesagent-20
                   entries the off arm medians 11/20 vs 12/20 on, i.e. ~1-2
                   scenarios of 20 (#1269). A pack that comes back 0/N is a
                   structural failure, not a thinking-off score — the
                   structural-zero guard drops it out of the reported TOTAL
                   whatever the cause (#1270).
  --thinking-max-tokens N
                   Completion budget for packs whose thinking gate resolves on
                   (pack default or --enable-thinking). Default 16384, sent
                   explicitly: benchlocal-cli would otherwise give thinking packs
                   the --max-tokens value. Also settable via THINKING_MAX_TOKENS.
  --max-tokens N   Completion budget for BOTH arms. Default 4096 — benchlocal's
                   per-pack ~1024 cuts long answers off into token_limit
                   failures that read as wrong answers (docs/RUN_EVALS.md).
                   Per-scenario timeouts scale with it on their own. Also
                   settable via MAX_TOKENS env.
  --pack-budgets   Use benchlocal-cli's own per-pack budgets (~1024 tokens,
                   300s model turns, 300s hermes episode) instead of the
                   wrapper's defaults — to compare with results taken that way.
                   Also settable via PACK_BUDGETS=1.
  --thinking-budget N
                   OPT-IN (never a default — every published BENCHMARKS row
                   was measured unbounded). Bound the model's REASONING to N
                   tokens in whatever spelling the serving engine uses, and
                   VERIFY it can take effect before running — refusing with
                   the fix when it cannot (#1383):
                     llama.cpp  boot flag --reasoning-budget N — the running
                                server must already carry EXACTLY N (the
                                shipped composes read REASONING_BUDGET=N);
                                a present-but-unset flag boots -1 = unbounded
                     vLLM       per-request thinking_token_budget; needs the
                                server booted with --reasoning-parser
                     SGLang     per-request custom_logit_processor +
                                custom_params.thinking_budget; needs the
                                server booted with --enable-custom-logit-processor
                   Also derives the matching client cap: --thinking-max-tokens
                   = N + THINKING_BUDGET_HEADROOM (default 4096) unless you set
                   one above N. A reasoning cap alone RELOCATES the overrun
                   into content (measured: 8192 budget, no total cap → one
                   request still reached 13,238 tokens).
                   Checked PER PACK CLASS: on vLLM/SGLang the selection may
                   not include hermesagent-20 / aider-polyglot-30 — their
                   agent runs inside the sandbox and makes its own model
                   calls, which a per-request budget never reaches. On
                   llama.cpp the boot flag governs them for free.
                   Also settable via THINKING_BUDGET env. Verification is
                   docker-inspect / server-readback based; when NO evidence is
                   available it refuses unless THINKING_BUDGET_UNVERIFIED=1.
  --retry-runaways
                   Forward to benchlocal-cli --retry-runaways: ALSO retry
                   timeout / token_limit runaway failures. **Default OFF** —
                   benchlocal retries model verdicts 3x but never runaways,
                   because each attempt is a full generation. Opt in when
                   slow-rig `timeout` rows (a single sample against a clock,
                   not a model verdict) are polluting the score (#1023).
  --strict-thinking
                   Forward to benchlocal-cli --strict-thinking: exit code 4
                   when the thinking-validity check finds a contaminated arm
                   (e.g. the "no-thinking" leg secretly reasoned). CI-friendly;
                   pair with the canonical two-leg run in docs/QUALITY_TEST.md.
  --report FORMAT  Forward to benchlocal-cli --report: emit the paste-ready
  --report-out PATH  Results Card v2 report, e.g. --report md --report-out card.md.
  --both-modes     Run BOTH reasoning legs back-to-back (#983A): first
                   --no-thinking, then --enable-thinking — each pinned to
                   --sampling-from-server unless already requested, so the
                   compose's per-mode sampler rows stay the single source of
                   truth and the legs differ only in the thinking gate.
                   With --report-out PATH, each leg writes its own card:
                   PATH.thinking-off.ext and PATH.thinking-on.ext. Exit code is
                   the worst leg's. Mutually exclusive with --enable-thinking,
                   --no-thinking, --resume (it drives those itself).
  --               Everything after `--` is forwarded VERBATIM to
                   `benchlocal-cli run` — appended after the wrapper's own
                   args, so pass-through flags can override wrapper ones.
                   Escape hatch for benchlocal-cli flags the wrapper doesn't
                   name (--model-turn-timeout, --timeout-ceiling-s,
                   --negative-control, ...):
                     bash scripts/quality-test.sh --full -- --retry-runaways --report md

ENV VARS
  URL              Endpoint base URL (default: auto-detected via preflight,
                   falls back to the registry-derived qwen3.6-27b default,
                   currently :8020)
  MODEL            Served model name. If set (env or --model), it's respected
                   verbatim — no /v1/models override. If UNSET, auto-detected
                   from /v1/models (fixes the wrong-name → HTTP 404 footgun on
                   single-model composes). --model and MODEL are equivalent.
  TIMEOUT_PER_CASE Per-scenario HTTP timeout override in seconds. UNSET means
                   benchlocal-cli's per-pack metadata default applies (60s for
                   the deterministic packs, 300s for cli-40 / hermesagent-20,
                   1800s for aider-polyglot-30; see benchlocal-cli #41).
                   --timeout-per-case is equivalent.
  ENABLE_THINKING Set to 1 to send request-level enable_thinking=true via
                   benchlocal-cli --enable-thinking. Default: 0.
  NO_THINKING     Set to 1 to force thinking off for every pack via
                   benchlocal-cli --no-thinking. Mutually exclusive with
                   ENABLE_THINKING. Default: 0.
  BOTH_MODES      Set to 1 to run both reasoning legs (--no-thinking then
                  --enable-thinking) in one invocation. --both-modes is
                  equivalent.
  THINKING_MAX_TOKENS
                   Completion budget for thinking-enabled packs (default 16384).
                   --thinking-max-tokens is equivalent.
  MAX_TOKENS       Completion budget for BOTH arms (default 4096).
                   --max-tokens is equivalent.
  PACK_BUDGETS     Set to 1 for benchlocal-cli's own per-pack budgets instead
                   of the defaults above. --pack-budgets is equivalent.
  BENCHLOCAL_MODEL_TURN_TIMEOUT
                   Cap on one runner-owned sandbox model call (cli-40,
                   bugfind-15). Default 900s here (benchlocal's 300s cannot fit
                   a 16384-token answer below ~55 tok/s).
  BENCHLOCAL_HERMES_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT_S
                   The hermes agent's per-scenario episode cap. Default 600s
                   here (benchlocal's 300s). Unlike the other packs' timeouts it
                   does not scale with the token budget.
  THINKING_BUDGET  Equivalent to --thinking-budget N (opt-in reasoning budget,
                   verified per engine and per pack class).
  THINKING_BUDGET_HEADROOM
                   Answer tokens added to the budget when deriving
                   --thinking-max-tokens (default 4096).
  THINKING_BUDGET_UNVERIFIED
                   Set to 1 to run --thinking-budget when NO evidence about the
                   server is available (no container, no readback). Positive
                   evidence that the budget would not take effect is never
                   bypassed. The run is labelled unverified.
  THINKING_BUDGET_SGLANG_PROCESSOR
                   SGLang only: the ThinkingBudgetLogitProcessor subclass to
                   send when the server's reasoning parser is not one the
                   wrapper maps (qwen3 / qwen3-thinking / glm45 / deepseek-r1).

OUTPUT
  - Markdown table to stdout (paste-ready for BENCHMARKS quality rows)
  - JSON blob to results/quality/quality-<timestamp>.json (full detail)
  - STRUCTURAL-ZERO GUARD block when ANY pack scored 0/N (#1270): both TOTALs
    (valid subset + all packs, the latter marked "do not cite") plus the zeroed
    pack's p50 as corroboration. Cause-agnostic and post-hoc — it reports the
    outcome and lists candidate causes, it does not guess one; the per-rig
    quality record is not published for such a run. A verifier_fail row is the
    MODEL being wrong and keeps counting — only a WHOLE pack at 0/N trips it.
  - Compact one-liner for the compose `Quality:` profile field, stamped with
    per-pack versions and run provenance (#981/#983E)

# OPT-IN, never a default: every published BENCHMARKS row was measured
# unbounded, and a default would silently break comparability with all of them.
#
# Verification IS the feature. llama.cpp's budget is a boot flag the harness
# cannot set per request — and the shipped composes always emit
# `--reasoning-budget "${REASONING_BUDGET:--1}"`, so the flag being PRESENT
# proves nothing; only its resolved VALUE does. vLLM v0.29.0 and SGLang v0.5.20
# reject the per-request field outright when their prerequisite is missing, so
# an unverified run would 400 on every scenario. Either way the run is not
# what it claims to be, so the wrapper reads the evidence first and refuses
# with the fix when it does not hold. Mechanism, evidence rules and the
# per-engine request shapes: scripts/lib/thinking-budget.sh.

# ---- budget defaults (docs/RUN_EVALS.md) -------------------------------------
# benchlocal-cli's per-pack budgets (~1024 completion tokens, 300s per sandbox
# model turn, 300s per hermes episode) cut long answers off into token_limit and
# timeout rows that read as wrong answers. Every published recipe passed the
# values below by hand, and a run that forgot them measured the budget rather
# than the model, so they are the defaults here. Each fills only what nothing
# set: a flag or env var wins, --pack-budgets keeps benchlocal's own, and
# --resume keeps the saved run's.
# --timeout-per-case is deliberately NOT defaulted (see TIMEOUT_PER_CASE_SET
# above): left unset, benchlocal scales each scenario's clock with the token
# budget and the rig's measured speed (benchlocal-cli #103), so 4096 tokens get
# a longer clock on their own. A fixed value switches that scaling off, cuts the
# thinking arm's clock, and lowers aider-polyglot-30's 1800s.

# ---- #1270: structural-zero guard — refuse a bare TOTAL when a pack scored 0/N
# The #960 preflight above guards ONE cause of a zeroed pack (endpoint not
# reachable from the sandbox container). @paulp83's #1253 endpoint WAS reachable,
# so that preflight passed correctly and the damage happened anyway: his leg A
# read 102/150 (68%) where the valid subset was 102/130 (78%) — ten points of
# apparent instruct deficit that was one structurally-zeroed pack.
#
# Any cause produces the same misleading arithmetic: unreachable endpoint
# (guarded above), a sandboxed pack whose agent harness failed to initialise,
# Docker dying mid-run, an image pull failure, a sandbox OOM, a pack version
# mismatch. So this check is cause-AGNOSTIC — it fires on the OUTCOME, after the
# results are in, whatever produced it. The 0/N is the trigger; latency is
# printed as corroboration only and never gates the warning.
#
# ⚠️ Deliberately NOT thinking-aware, and #1269 is why. That issue proposed
# treating hermesagent-20 as incompatible with --no-thinking; the saved results
# refute it. Across 150 full 20-scenario hermesagent-20 entries (per-pack
# thinking_enabled, run-level as fallback): thinking OFF n=74, median 11/20,
# range 0-15, 4 runs at 0/20; thinking ON n=76, median 12/20, range 0-16, 6 runs
# at 0/20. Structural zeros occur on BOTH arms and slightly MORE often with
# thinking ON, and paired per model the off arm costs ~1-2 scenarios of 20 — the
# same graceful degradation the other three thinking-default-on packs show. So
# forced thinking-off is NOT a candidate cause, and a guard that pointed at it
# would send triage the wrong way. It is also why no blanket pre-run drop of the
# pack exists: it would discard valid measurements, and benchlocal-cli has no
# pack-exclusion flag anyway (the only wrapper-side spelling is a scenario
# enumeration, which tags the run PARTIAL).
#
# Three of those four thinking-off zeros are ONE incident: three consecutive
# runs, every scenario ~1.5s, reported as 20 x verifier_fail, trace carrying
# agent_exit_code=1 / tool_events=0 / an AIAgent.__init__() keyword mismatch. A
# harness constructor fault wearing the model's label — which is exactly the
# shape this guard exists to catch, and which qualifies the verifier_fail
# caveat below: per row a verifier_fail is the model being wrong, but a WHOLE
# PACK of them can be the harness.
#
# Exit contract of the probe below: 0 = nothing to report, 3 = a pack scored
# 0/N (block printed), anything else = the probe itself broke and said so.

# --- emit the per-rig #249 quality record (c3's per-rig "8pk" column reads
# results/measurement-records/*.jsonl). QUALITY_RECORD=0 skips. Emits whatever
# total the run produced (P/T — /150 on --full, /75 on --medium, etc.); a later
# quality run's score supersedes in c3 (append-only history kept). resolve-serving
# maps the served container -> slug; unmatched/bare-metal runs skip cleanly. This
# writes a quality-ONLY record (no TPS) that MERGES with the bench TPS record.
# Same defect, a different consumer: the record's 8pk field IS a bare TOTAL
# (c3 renders it verbatim), so a run that tripped the structural-zero guard has
# no citable figure to publish. Skip it and say so — the skip and this notice
# are the same branch.
