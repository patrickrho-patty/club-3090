"""v0.8.0 Pull-Emit-Derived `[E]` — STEP E2: the HF download stage.

CONTRACT-3 (the brief's locked E2 spec). This module owns ONLY the download
stage; it does NOT wire into `run_pull()` (E4), does NOT boot or emit capture
artifacts (E3), does NOT write docs (E5). It returns a structured
`DownloadResult` — the §6 capture-point-2 payload shape — which E3 will later
emit as an artifact; E2 just returns the struct.

Public API (stable for E3/E4)

CONTRACT-3 invariants enforced here
-----------------------------------
* Fetch EXACTLY `deriver.download_set(api)` — `hf download <slug>
  --local-dir <staging> --include <pat>` with ONE `--include` per
  `download_set` entry (exact filenames are valid globs). The include set
  IS the literal shared `download_set` list `[C2a]` sized. A test asserts
  fetched-set == sized-set (nothing extra).
* SHA: every `*.safetensors` — verified against the **HF model API
  `siblings[].lfs.sha256`** (the canonical per-file LFS SHA256), keyed by
  filename, sourced from the SAME `/api/models/<repo>?blobs=true` payload
  the deriver already fetched and stashed at `der.profile["_hf_api"]`
  (CONTRACT-3 additive surface). SHA256(file) == that lfs.sha256.
  **UNLIKE `setup.sh:434/437` (prints SKIP, does NOT count a failure on a
  missing hash), a *.safetensors with NO retrievable `lfs.sha256` is a
  HARD E2 failure** (`failure="no-etag"`). Never silently trust an
  unverifiable multi-GB weight. SHA mismatch -> `failure="sha-mismatch"`.
  Metadata files: presence + size only.

  NOTE — the verify SOURCE moved (E2-fix-2, on-rig E5): the prior path was
  a per-file HF HEAD -> `x-linked-etag`. On Xet-backed repos the
  `huggingface.co` resolve hop 302-redirects into `cas-bridge.xethub.hf.co`
  (Xet CAS); the post-redirect CAS response carries a CAS-blob `ETag` but
  NO `x-linked-etag`, so a redirect-following HEAD sees no `x-linked-etag`
  -> a FALSE `no-etag` (an on-rig run of
  `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` hit exactly this). The canonical LFS
  SHA256 is instead read from the model API `siblings[].lfs.sha256` the
  deriver ALREADY retrieves — redirect-immune, single source. ONLY the
  hash source changed; the hard-fail-if-unverifiable CONTRACT-3 decision,
  the failure token, and every other invariant are byte-unchanged.
* Atomic staging: download into
  `<hf_home>/club3090/pulls/<slug-sanitized>/.incomplete/`; on full success
  + all SHA verified, atomically move into
  `<hf_home>/club3090/pulls/<slug-sanitized>/` (the CONTRACT-2 host
  `--model` dir E1 emits the mount for). On ANY failure delete the
  `.incomplete` tree — no corrupt/partial residue (the `aria2c`
  corruption-incident lesson).
* The real fetcher shells out to the `hf` CLI (the SAME established
  pattern as `setup.sh:404-423` — prefer `hf`, legacy fallback
  `huggingface-cli`, else a structured actionable failure). It is NOT the
  `huggingface_hub` Python library: on this stack `huggingface_hub` is not
  installed in the bare `python3` that `scripts/pull.sh` runs under (it
  exists only as a `uv tool` exposing the `hf` CLI). An on-rig E5 run
  caught the prior lib-import as `ModuleNotFoundError("No module named
  'huggingface_hub'")`. The fetcher is injectable so tests are hermetic (a
  recorded-fixture fetcher / mocked subprocess; NO live multi-GB network
  in CI).

Two later additions, both in `hf_fetch.py` (see its docstring for the full
rationale) and both wired here:

* **#804 — the download resilience ladder.** The classic `hf download` above
  is rung 1 and stays FIRST and unchanged. When (and only when) it exits with
  huggingface_hub's client-side too-large refusal — a hard policy wall for
  files over 50 GB, not flakiness — `HubFetcher.snapshot` escalates: rung 2
  (Xet) if the operator opted in AND `hf_xet` is already importable, else
  rung 3 (single-stream resumable `curl` against the resolve endpoint). Both
  fallback rungs run a mandatory independent sha256 gate and DELETE a
  mismatching artifact. No parallel-chunk downloader is ever used.

* **#812 — verify-in-place + announce WHY.** Before any bytes move,
  `_download_model_impl` announces, per already-present file, what was found
  and what will happen to it. With `VERIFY_IN_PLACE=1` a metadata-less local
  file is sha256'd against the hub and ADOPTED on a match (0 bytes
  re-downloaded, HF metadata stub written) instead of silently re-pulled.
  Size agreement alone is never called "verified".
