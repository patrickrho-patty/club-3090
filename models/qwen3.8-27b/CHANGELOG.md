# Qwen3.8-27B — Changelog

Dated history for Qwen3.8-27B configs in this repo. Append-only — add a new entry, don't rewrite past ones.

## 2026-09-04 — dual-fast: `MAMBA_BLOCK_SIZE` knob — the "2.17×/2.49× concurrency" pool figures were ~20% optimistic; 8192-token SSM checkpoints recover it (2×242K concurrent, 0 preemptions)

**Finding.** vLLM's "GPU KV cache size: N tokens" counts attention KV only. In `--mamba-cache-mode align` (the shipped default) the GDN/SSM state is checkpointed at **every attention block** — 1,616 tokens on this slug, since align pads the attention block up to the mamba page — and those state pages are carved out of the *same* pool at runtime without appearing in N. Measured on the ref 2×3090 (v0.27.1, W4A8, MTP n=4, util 0.92, 4 seqs): pool reported **530,081 tokens (2.02×)**, but two ~200K prompts filled it (`kv_cache_usage_perc` → 0.98) at ~400K live tokens, preempted twice and serialized (TTFT 292 s / 481 s). Effective capacity ≈ **80% of nominal**, so the header's 652,346 → 2.49× and 567,737 → 2.17× read as ~2.0× / ~1.75× in practice. `max_num_seqs` (4→2: +0.8%), util 0.90→0.92 (+3%), `MAX_NUM_BATCHED_TOKENS` 8192→4096 (0 — the 1.96 GiB "peak activation" reserve is fixed) and `MAMBA_CACHE_MODE=none` (a no-op while prefix caching is on) do not move it.

**Fix.** `--mamba-block-size 8192` checkpoints the SSM state every 8,192 tokens instead of every 1,616 (≈5× fewer state pages per sequence; prefix-cache hit granularity is unchanged — see the trade-off check below). Same boot, same nominal 530,081: **2×200K ran fully concurrent, 0 preemptions, KV peak 0.77; 2×242K fully concurrent, 0 preemptions, KV peak 0.91; both answers correct.** Prefix caching intact — a re-sent ~100K prompt: TTFT 109.8 s cold → 3.7 s warm (29×). `--mamba-cache-dtype bfloat16` changed nothing here (the state is already bf16 under `auto`), kept as a knob. At util 0.94 the pool is 556,150 (2.12×) and 2×258K completes concurrently with 0 preemptions — but the CUDA caching allocator logs `expandable_segments … OOM … free: 5 MB` at the prefill peak, i.e. zero margin; 0.92 stays the recommendation (2×~245K comfortable).

**Wired.** Entrypoint knobs `MAMBA_BLOCK_SIZE=<tokens>` and `MAMBA_CACHE_DTYPE=<dtype>` (both off by default → upstream behaviour unchanged), plus the same `ASYNC_SCHED=off` → `--no-async-scheduling` toggle the `dual-max` compose got in #1139 (this compose already vendors `vllm-flashinfer-decode-pin` + `vllm-gdn-mtp-async-spec-order`; the async-off mitigation for the still-open [vllm#50021](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/50021) was missing). Header note added next to `--mamba-cache-mode`. Likely applies to every Qwen3.x hybrid-GDN slug that runs `align` — worth re-deriving the catalog's KV-pool concurrency claims with a live `kv_cache_usage_perc` probe rather than the boot-log token count.

**Trade-off check (2026-09-05) — no per-turn tail-block cost.** Review concern: a bigger mamba block means a bigger always-uncached tail per turn (up to 8K tokens ≈ 4 s at 2K tok/s prefill) — a real cost for short interactive/voice traffic. Measured instead of assumed: prompt sweep 2K / 5K / 10K / 20K / 50K / 100K / 150K / 200K, each cold + 3 follow-ups appending ~250 tokens, 500-token greedy answers, thinking off, MTP n=4, at `MAMBA_BLOCK_SIZE` **1616 (unset) / 4096 / 8192**, reading follow-up TTFT, decode tok/s and vLLM's `prefix_cache_queries − hits` (= tokens actually re-prefilled) per request. Mean of the 3 follow-ups:

| prompt | TTFT 1616 / 4096 / 8192 (s) | decode 1616 / 4096 / 8192 (tok/s) | uncached tail (identical in all three) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2K | 1.37 / 1.37 / 1.37 | 69.5 / 71.4 / 69.9 | 2.3–2.8K (prompt shorter than one block → nothing cached, in every config) |
| 5K | 1.30 / 1.29 / 1.30 | 72.5 / 72.9 / 72.3 | 2.0–2.5K |
| 10K | 1.45 / 1.45 / 1.45 | 71.5 / 70.7 / 70.5 | 2.2–2.7K |
| 20K | 1.71 / 1.70 / 1.71 | 68.9 / 69.1 / 68.8 | 2.5–3.0K |
| 50K | 1.99 / 1.99 / 2.00 | 66.4 / 66.7 / 66.6 | 2.0–3.4K |
| 100K | 2.95 / 2.94 / 2.95 | 63.5 / 64.6 / 63.5 | 2.1–3.4K |
| 150K | 3.56 / 3.56 / 3.56 | 59.1 / 62.7 / 59.2 | 2.0–3.3K |
| 200K | 4.67 / 4.66 / 4.67 | 54.7 / 56.4 / 54.9 | 2.8–3.3K |

The uncached-token count per request is the same integer in all three configs at every length, so the block size does not change how much of the tail gets re-prefilled: on v0.27.1 prefix-cache keys are computed every `--prefix-match-unit` (16 here) tokens and a hit that ends inside a physical block is served through a copy-on-write tail block, so `mamba_block_size` only sets how many SSM state pages a sequence allocates (the capacity win), not where a follow-up can resume. Cold TTFT and decode are likewise identical (decode drifts 72 → 55 tok/s from 2K to 200K depth in every config — context cost, not the knob). The decode column sits below the BENCHMARKS row (80.6 / 113.6) because the sweep's answer is a long-form essay at greedy, on which the MTP drafter accepts only ~1.6 tokens/step; a code task on the same boot accepts ~2.8/step and decodes at 108 tok/s. Verified the nonsense-word prefix is not the cause (75.7 vs 75.3 tok/s with/without it) — treat the column as a same-workload A/B, not a throughput figure. `4096` was also checked for capacity: 2×200K concurrent, 0 preemptions. Recommendation unchanged: knob stays opt-in; set 8192 (or 4096) when you run long concurrent sessions, leave it unset otherwise — either way per-turn latency is the same.

## 2026-09-02 — dual-max: `ASYNC_SCHED=off` wired — vllm#50021 mitigation (1), drafter kept at ~0% cost

The `dual/fp8/mtp.yml` header has documented two mitigations for the [vllm#50021](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/50021) MTP × hybrid-GDN wild write since the 2026-08-19 production crash (#1059): (1) `ASYNC_SCHED=off` → `--no-async-scheduling`, which keeps the drafter, and (2) `SPEC=off`, which drops it. Only (2) was actually plumbed — `ASYNC_SCHED` was header prose with no env passthrough and no entrypoint branch, so anyone following the header got the drafter-off path by default and paid for it in decode. This wires (1) the same way `SPEC` is wired: env passthrough + entrypoint `case`, off by default, appended to both `exec vllm serve` branches.

**Measured on-rig (2026-09-02, ref 2×3090 PCIe, v0.27.1, canonical 3 warm + 5 measured, same boot family):**

| Config | narr / **code** decode | prefill @10K / @90K | TTFT | MTP AL |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| `SPEC=off` (mitigation 2) | 44.2 / **45.1** | 1353 / 1097 | 77–84 ms | — |
| `ASYNC_SCHED=off`, MTP n=3 (mitigation 1) | **67.8 / 88.1** | 1316 / 1058 | 98–113 ms | 3.0–3.3 |
| BENCHMARKS row 2026-08-17 (async ON, MTP n=3) | 67.4 / 85.8 | 1166 / 942 | 152 ms | 2.62 |

Mitigation (1) restores **+53% prose / +95% code** decode over the drafter-off path and is at parity or better with the async-ON catalog row on every column — the header's ~0% cost claim holds. Decode CV 2.1% / 3.3%; VRAM 22.3 GB/card, 0 MiB leak; no Xid / CUDA-error signatures across bench + 8-pack + verify-full on the new config. ⚠️ This bounds the crash *mechanism* the maintainer identified (MTP + prefix-cache + async), not #50021 itself, which is still open — a 10-minute bench is not 44 h of agent traffic. If Xid 31 recurs, `SPEC=off` remains the fallback.
## 2026-08-23 — every vLLM slug accepts `reasoning_effort: "high"` again (mapped to `medium`)

All 20 Qwen3.8 vLLM slugs returned **HTTP 500** on any thinking-mode request carrying `reasoning_effort: "high"`. Qwen3.8's ladder is `low` / `medium` / `xhigh` — there is **no `high`** — and the stock `chat_template.jinja` `raise_exception()`s on anything else. OpenAI and Anthropic both use `low`/`medium`/`high`, so a generic client sending the standard top rung got a Jinja `TemplateError` surfaced as a 500. Reported on-rig through vLLM's Anthropic-compatible `POST /v1/messages`: a Claude-API client turns thinking **on** and sends `high`, which overrides *both* keys of `--default-chat-template-kwargs` (a fallback for callers that send nothing, never a clamp) and re-arms the raise that the shipped `enable_thinking: false` default otherwise keeps dormant.

⚠️ **Wider than first reported, since the 2026-09-01 thinking flip (#1135):** `ENABLE_THINKING` now defaults to `true` on all 20 slugs, so `reasoning_effort` is read on *every* request and the raise is armed by default — a caller no longer has to opt into thinking to reach it. `ENABLE_THINKING=false` is now the only thing that puts it back to sleep.

⚠️ **The failure mode is the dangerous kind:** `/v1/models` and `/health` keep returning 200 and the model is demonstrably serving, so the endpoint looks healthy while every thinking-mode chat request fails.

New patch [`qwen38-reasoning-effort-template`](vllm/patches/qwen38-reasoning-effort-template/PROVENANCE.md) — the model's own template plus **seven lines** mapping `high` → `medium` before the validation. `medium` is the **un-nudged baseline** (no branch in the template, no injected preamble), deliberately not `xhigh`: `xhigh` injects a "think carefully, validate assumptions, consider alternatives" preamble that is slow and timeout-prone, and a Claude-API client sends `high` on *every* request, which would put all agent traffic in the slowest mode on slugs shipping `max_num_seqs=1`. `xhigh` remains reachable by name; `xhigh`/`medium`/`low` and invalid values are byte-for-byte unchanged.

**Wired mount-only** — bind-mounted *over* the served checkpoint's own `chat_template.jinja`, which vLLM auto-loads from the model dir, so no `--chat-template` argument and the compose `command:` lists are untouched (the carnice override's style, not froggeric's). That is a rebase-surface choice: 11 upstream commits touched these composes in the 7 days to 2026-08-23, and an inserted flag collides with every one of them.

One vendored file covers all 20 slugs: `chat_template.jinja` is sha256 `c3cf9e34…81041` (8,952 bytes) on all three served checkpoints — official FP8, the Frozenlock AutoRound INT4 repack, and the RadixArk NVFP4 export — unchanged by the [#1070](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/1070) weights swap. The DFlash2 drafter repo ships no `chat_template.jinja` at all and is never the render source.

## 2026-08-23 — dual-fast: FlashInfer decode-buffer unpin merged (#1051) — MTP concurrency unlocked to C=32

Merged **[#1051](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/1051)** (thanks **@A1RM4X** — reproduced independently on-rig before promoting). New patch [`vllm-flashinfer-decode-pin`](vllm/patches/vllm-flashinfer-decode-pin/README.md) flips `pin_memory=True→False` on the `flashinfer/decode.py` workspace-buffer allocs, forcing a synchronous plan copy per step and closing the stale-plan async-copy race ([vllm#40756](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/40756)) that crashed `vllm/qwen38-27b-dual-fast` (W4A8 + MTP n=4 + fp8 KV) with an Xid 31 VIRT_READ under concurrency. Idempotent, marker-gated, no-ops without FlashInfer, hard-fails on drift (boot-refused). Wired on `mtp.yml` alongside `vllm-gdn-mtp-async-spec-order` (the two fix **distinct** bugs: async wild-write vs decode-plan race).

**On-rig validation (2026-08-23, ref 2×3090, v0.27.1, real delivery path — switch.sh → compose mount → entrypoint install.sh):** the fix holds far past the PR's conservative c=4 claim. With `MAX_NUM_SEQS=32` it survived the full concurrency ladder **clean to C=32** (spec-ON MTP n=4): agg 71→241 tok/s (C=1→32), per-stream decode 84→18, drafter accepting (mean accept 2.85), zero crashes. Unpatched, the same slug crashes at C≥8. Distinct from DFlash2 (dual-superfast), which OOMs at C=8 regardless (VRAM, not this race). Full A/B + all four arms: `learnings/qwen3.8-27b.md` 2026-08-23.

## 2026-08-21 — DFlash2 super/ultra tiers benched (full matrix); iq4xs single-card slug; HOL flag

**The DFlash2 tier hierarchy is measured.** All six dual slugs benched fresh, same session (canonical 3 warm + 5 measured, stock `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.27.1` + the vendored [`vllm-dflash2-backport`](vllm/patches/vllm-dflash2-backport/README.md) of [vllm#52816](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/52816)). Decode TPS, narrative / **code**:

| Slug | Drafter · KV / attn | Ctx | narr / **code** | vs base |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|
| `dual-fast` | MTP n=4 · fp8 | 262K | 73 / **100** | — |
| `dual-superfast` | DFlash2 · fp8 / FlashInfer | 262K | 78 / **141** | **+41%** |
| `dual-ultrafast` | DFlash2 · bf16 / FA2 | ~200K | 128 / **231** | **+131%** |
| `dual-max` | MTP n=3 · fp8 | 262K | 69 / **87** | — |
| `dual-supermax` | DFlash2 · fp8 / FlashInfer | 144K | 68 / **130** | **+49%** |
| `dual-ultramax` | DFlash2 · bf16 / FA2 | 64K | 90 / **172** | **+98%** |

Two structural findings: (1) the **FA2 ⊕ fp8-KV mutual exclusion on Ampere** is what splits `super` (fp8 KV → FlashInfer → keeps 262K, ~40% slower decode) from `ultra` (bf16 KV → FA2 → fastest decode, but 2× KV so context drops); (2) the **fidelity (fp8-weight) series decodes slower than the speed (int4) series** — Ampere has no native fp8 compute, so fp8 weights upcast to fp16. Full numbers + prefill/VRAM in [`../../BENCHMARKS.md`](../../) (stack) and `learnings/qwen3.8-27b.md`.

**Single-card slug swapped `iq4nl` → `iq4xs`.** unsloth removed `Qwen3.8-27B-IQ4_NL.gguf` from the repo (2026-08-19), so `llamacpp/qwen38-27b-single-iq4nl` is dead. Replacement `llamacpp/qwen38-27b-single-iq4xs` (unsloth UD-IQ4_XS, 14.3 GB) ships **q4_0 KV at the full 262144** (halving the KV clears the q8 build's 131072 ceiling) **+ F16 vision** (mmproj-F16, `WITH_VISION=1`). Decode 61.6 narr / 71.3 code; NIAH-clean to 240,635 (91% of n_ctx); one correct image recognition. ⚠️ **q4_0 KV is below the stack serving floor** — a max-ctx / vision *exhibit*, not serving-grade; `KV_TYPE=q8_0 CTX_SIZE=131072` restores the q8@131K config. **🐣 Incubating.** (PR [#1068](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/1068).)

**HOL flag defaulted.** `--long-prefill-token-threshold 4096` added to all 20 vLLM composes (env `LONG_PREFILL_TOKEN_THRESHOLD`, 0 disables). Inert at the shipped `max_num_seqs=1` — preparatory for concurrency (Zylone's tip; qwen3.6 dual-fast precedent).

**Fast-tier weights swap** `Avuja` → `Frozenlock` (both AutoRound INT4) landed earlier — see [vllm#52873](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/52873): the permanent MTP acceptance-collapse was checkpoint-specific to Avuja, not a vLLM bug (PR [#1070](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/pull/1070)).

**Port hygiene.** Resolved 3 cross-model `default_port` collisions by moving the qwen3.8 side: `single-iq4xs` 8086→8090, `dual-fast` 8095→8113, `multi4-fast` 8096→8114 (nemotron/inkling/agents-a1 keep their ports). New gate `scripts/tests/test-compose-port-conflicts.sh` fails on any cross-model port overlap (aliases + same-model variants allowed); 8020/8032 allowlisted pending a separate hygiene PR.

## 2026-08-14/16 — onboarding: 5 incubating slugs + v0.27.1 pin + W4A8 default

Qwen3.8-27B onboarded as 🐣 Incubating across llama.cpp + vLLM (1/2/4/8 cards). Served from the official [FP8 checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8) and unsloth's [dynamic GGUFs](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF); AutoRound INT4 fast tier ships **W4A8** (int8 activations) by default. Numbers deliberately withheld at onboarding after a bench ran on a silently-degraded (pipeline-parallelism-off) config — see discussion [#993](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/993) for the slugs, the sampler rows, and the traps. Same Qwen3-Next hybrid-GDN architecture as 3.5/3.6, so it inherits the [vllm#50021](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/50021) MTP crash exposure (mitigate `SPEC=off`).
