# test-thinking-control.sh — the reasoning-switch detection contract.
#
# WHICH request field turns a model's reasoning off is not universal, and an
# unrecognised one is silently ignored — no error, no warning. The whole script
# layer had the Qwen key (`chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking`) baked in, so
# on a model that uses a different one the switch did nothing, the model reasoned
# at full effort, and every short-budget check spent its entire allowance on the
# reasoning preamble before emitting a content token. verify-full's [3/9] and
# [5/9] then failed reporting "Model may be loading badly or wrong chat
# template" — sending you to debug a template that was in fact correct.
# Found on Inkling-Small 2026-08-12, whose template takes an effort DIAL
# (`reasoning_effort`: none/minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh, default 0.9).
#
# Why this test exists rather than a live model run: any single served model
# exercises exactly ONE branch of the detector. Inkling covers the template-scan
# reasoning_effort path and nothing else — in particular the behavioural-probe
# path, which is what EVERY vLLM/SGLang model takes (they ship no /props), would
# never execute. This drives all of them against a mock endpoint, deterministic
# and GPU-free.
#
# Asserts, per scenario: the detected control, the chat_template_kwargs object,
# and the top-level OpenAI `reasoning_effort` fragment.
#
#   template scan (llama.cpp /props)
#     1. template mentions enable_thinking      → enable_thinking
#     2. template mentions reasoning_effort     → reasoning_effort + std param
#     3. template mentions BOTH                 → enable_thinking  ← no-regression
#     4. template mentions neither              → none, empty kwargs
#   behavioural probe (vLLM / SGLang — no /props)
#     5. enable_thinking yields content         → enable_thinking
#     6. only reasoning_effort yields content   → reasoning_effort + std param
#     7. neither yields content                 → none
#   safety
#     8. endpoint unreachable                   → enable_thinking (today's shape)
#     9. env override wins AND suppresses the top-level param
#
# Scenario 3 is the load-bearing one: it is what guarantees this change can only
# ADD coverage. Every model passing today keeps its exact request shape.
