# Gate: no two DISTINCT active slugs from DIFFERENT models share a default_port.
#
# Why: default_port is the host port the launcher/c3/estate bind a slug to. Two
# different models on the same port can't co-reside (GPU0+GPU1 small models), and
# it breaks slug<->port identity in c3 even on this one-model-at-a-time rig. Ports
# were historically assigned per-model with no global check, so overlaps crept in
# (qwen3.8's 8091-8112 block overlapped nemotron; iq4nl/iq4xs shared 8086 with
# inkling). This gate stops that regressing.
#
# Policy (three cases, only the third fails):
#   (a) ALIAS         — same compose_path under two slug names  -> OK
#   (b) SAME-MODEL    — variants of ONE model (mutually exclusive) -> OK
#   (c) CROSS-MODEL   — distinct models, distinct compose_paths  -> FAIL
#
# Deprecated slugs are excluded (they're not launchable). Known pre-existing
# cross-model collisions are allowlisted (ALLOW) and tracked for a separate
# hygiene PR; the gate ALSO fails if an ALLOW entry no longer collides, so the
# list can't silently rot (negative control).
