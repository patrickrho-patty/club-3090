# test-compose-entrypoint-env-declared.sh — an entrypoint may only read env vars
# that docker actually forwards.
#
# THE CLASS: docker forwards ONLY what `environment:` declares. An entrypoint that
# branches on `$${FOO}` when FOO is undeclared reads an ALWAYS-EMPTY value, so the
# knob is inert while the compose still documents it. Nothing errors; the surface
# looks correct. Five instances found (THREADS, -np/NPARALLEL, shmem_enabled,
# VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER, MMPROJ) — see club-3090-todo.md 2026-08-30/31. All fixed.
#
# ⚠️ Declaring it as `- FOO=${FOO:-}` does NOT fix it: that sets FOO to the EMPTY
# STRING, which differs from unset and, for numeric knobs, atoi("") == 0 silently
# DISABLES the feature. Use the bare form `- FOO`.
