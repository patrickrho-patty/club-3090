# test-soak-decode-basis — canvas-granularity decode reporting (#809, soak half).
#
# decode TPS = completion_tokens / (wall - ttft) assumes autoregressive
# streaming. Canvas-granularity (block-diffusion) models denoise a whole canvas
# in parallel and emit ~one chunk per canvas, so a short response arrives whole,
# ttft == wall, and the window is zero-width. soak printed decode_tps=0.0 on 20
# of 25 turns in #809 — a wrong number replaced by a misleading one, with the
# zeros then dropped from the summary's percentiles so the run silently
# described only the multi-canvas subset.
#
# Contract asserted here:
#   1. canvas turns report a wall-derived figure, LABELLED, never a bare 0.0
#   2. the summary states the measured/derived split and keeps the two series
#      apart (wall TPS includes prefill; it is not a decode rate)
#   3. genuine silent-empty (completion_tokens == 0) still reports 0.0 and still
#      counts toward the silent-empty verdict — the discriminator must not regress
#   4. a fast AUTOREGRESSIVE rig with a narrow-but-real window (#849: 82 ms on
#      dual NVFP4 5090s) is NOT reclassified as canvas
#   5. SOAK_DECODE_GRANULARITY=autoregressive restores the pre-fix behaviour
#
# ⚠️ Two expectations here were SUPERSEDED by #1267 / #1268, deliberately:
#   - a narrow-but-real window no longer prints `decode_tps=0.0`. That zero was
#     byte-identical to a genuine silent-empty turn, so it now renders as
#     `decode_tps=n/a` plus the window width. The byte-identity-with-master leg
#     therefore covers the `ok` shape only; `narrow` asserts the new contract.
#   - a run with unmeasurable turns now DOES emit a "Decode-window basis:" line.
#     It used to appear only when a canvas turn existed, which left an
#     autoregressive run's p50 describing an unstated subset of its turns.
# What has NOT changed, and is still asserted below: canvas turns stay
# wall-derived and labelled, the two series stay apart, and the silent-empty
# discriminator still keys on completion_tokens.
