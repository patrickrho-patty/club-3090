# engine-kind.sh — THE single source of truth for "which engine family is this?"

# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (club-3090#1282, @paulp83)
# ----------------------------------------------
# Engine classification used to be re-implemented in every script that needed
# it. `spec-sweep.sh` carried a private TWO-valued version —
#     print("vllm" if eng.startswith("vllm") else "llamacpp")
# — so `sglang-stable` fell through to `llamacpp` and the sweep hunted for a
# llama.cpp server that was never there. That was the SIXTH site of a defect
# closed at five the same morning (#1263), and the five-site fix was itself five
# more private arms. The rules now live here once; scripts keep their own
# evidence-gathering (they genuinely have different evidence available) and
# delegate only the DECISION.
#
# CONTRACT
# --------
# Every function prints exactly one of: vllm | llamacpp | sglang | exllamav3 | unknown
# and returns 0. "unknown" is a value, not an error — callers must handle it
# rather than treating silence as a kind. Nothing here touches the network.

#   engine_kind_from_container   <container name>             e.g. sglang-qwen38
#   engine_kind_from_image       <docker image ref>           e.g. lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.19

# would silently read "unknown".
