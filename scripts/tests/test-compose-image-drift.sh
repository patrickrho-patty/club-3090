# Drift guard (Codex review, #254/#324): every vLLM compose whose
# `image: ${VLLM_IMAGE:-<literal>}` default is a FIXED docker image must match the
# install.spec of the engine its registry slug resolves to. This catches the
# "bump the engine spec but forget the compose literal" drift that would silently
# feed direct `docker compose` users a stale image (the launcher injects VLLM_IMAGE
# from the engine and is fine; the compose literal is the unguarded path).
#
# Skipped (by design):
#   - templated literals like `…:nightly-${VLLM_NIGHTLY_SHA}` — self-sync via the
#     launcher-injected var, so the literal is always in step with the engine.
#   - pip-method engines (vllm-pip-baseline) — no docker image to match.

# report "ok"; after widening it REDS on both.
# Safe to take the first match per compose: verified 0 composes carry >1 FIXED image
# literal, so there is no sidecar ambiguity. If that changes, compare the literal
