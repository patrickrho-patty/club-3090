# profiles-local — your LOCAL model layer

This directory holds models **you** added to this checkout — community models,
fine-tunes, experiments. Nothing here is ever committed: the curated catalog in
`scripts/lib/profiles/` stays maintainer-only, and `git pull` / branch switches
can never conflict with your local additions.

Everything here is gitignored except this README and the `.gitignore` itself.

## Layout

```
scripts/lib/profiles-local/
├── README.md            ← this file (committed)
├── .gitignore           ← keeps the contents below out of git (committed)
├── models.d/<id>.yml    ModelProfile YAML — same schema as scripts/lib/profiles/models/
├── composes/<id>/...    your compose files (same profile-schema layout as models/<id>/)
└── registry.local.json  registry entries: { "<slug>": { …_entry kwargs… } }
```

## The easy way: c3 → ⑤ Promote

In the cockpit's Bring & Validate lane, run a ① Bring fit-check on your repo,
then press **P** (⑤ Promote). The scaffold pre-fills every arch fact the
deriver knows; you fill `display_name` + `family`, confirm, and the gated write
plan runs:

```
python3 scripts/lib/profiles/promote.py --layer local --spec-env C3_PROMOTE_SPEC \
  && bash scripts/diagnose-profile.sh <slug> \
  && bash scripts/preflight-add-model.sh <slug>
```

That writes all three artifacts above and prints `PROMOTE_OK <slug>`.

## Removing a local model

```
python3 scripts/lib/profiles/demote.py --slug local/<name>            # asks first
python3 scripts/lib/profiles/demote.py --slug local/<name> --dry-run  # show the plan
```

Removes all three artifacts and prints `DEMOTE_OK <slug>`. It takes the
**registry entry out first**: if a later unlink fails you are left with files but
no slug, never a slug pointing at files that are gone — the second is the one
that breaks every launcher, because the catalog keeps offering a config whose
compose no longer exists.

It only ever touches this layer. There is no `--layer core`: a curated entry
lives in git-tracked files and git is its removal tool, so asking to remove a
non-`local/` slug is refused before anything is read. If two local slugs share a
model id, the shared profile and compose tree are **kept** and only the slug you
named is unregistered.

## The manual way

1. Write `models.d/<id>.yml` (copy the shape of an existing
   `scripts/lib/profiles/models/*.yml`; see `docs/ADDING_MODELS.md`).
2. Put your compose under `composes/<id>/<engine>/compose/<topology>/<quant>/base.yml`
   with a `# Profile (at-a-glance):` header carrying `Status: 🐣 Incubating`.
3. Append an entry to `registry.local.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "local/my-model-dual-autoround-int4": {
       "model": "my-model",
       "weights_variant": "autoround-int4",
       "workload": "long-ctx-single",
       "engine": "vllm-stable",
       "drafter": null,
       "kv_format": "fp8_e5m2",
       "tp": 2,
       "max_ctx": 131072,
       "max_num_seqs": 2,
       "mem_util": 0.92,
       "compose_path": "scripts/lib/profiles-local/composes/my-model/vllm/compose/dual/autoround-int4/base.yml",
       "default_port": 20230,
       "status": "incubating"
     }
   }
   ```

   Keys are exactly the `compose_registry._entry(...)` kwargs; defaults are
   applied the same way. Validate with `bash scripts/diagnose-profile.sh <slug>`.

## Rules

- **Slug namespace:** local slugs MUST start with `local/`. The loader refuses
  anything else, and refuses any slug or model id that collides with a core
  catalog row (loudly — a broken `registry.local.json` fails the launch rather
  than silently shrinking the catalog).
- **Status:** local entries start at `"incubating"` — hidden from
  `switch.sh --list`, launched only with `--force` (see the Status enum in
  `compose_registry.py`). Promote up the enum locally as your model validates.
- **Never a default:** local entries are visible to every runtime lookup
  (`launch.sh`, `switch.sh`, `diagnose-profile.sh`, the cockpit catalog) via
  `get_registry()`, but the curated-default tables (`DEFAULTS`,
  `ENGINE_PREFERENCE`, `RECOMMENDED_DEFAULT_MODELS`) stay core-only — a local
  model can never become someone's auto-default.
- **No core writes:** adding a model to the CURATED catalog is a maintainer PR.
  `promote.py --layer core` exists for that workflow and is double-gated
  (`--layer core` **and** `C3_ALLOW_CORE_PROMOTE=1`); it edits
  `compose_registry.py` directly and should only ever run in a maintainer
  checkout on a clean branch (git is the rollback).

## Uninstall

Delete the file(s): `rm scripts/lib/profiles-local/models.d/<id>.yml`, the
compose dir, and the JSON entry. There is nothing else to revert — no core file
was ever touched.

## Ports — the 202xx band

The curated catalog occupies **8010–8199** and grows over time, so a local model
parked there can collide with a slug that lands in a later `git pull` — and it turns
the repo's own `test-compose-port-conflicts` guard red on *your* checkout, whose fix
text invites editing a curated entry you should never touch.

Local models use **202xx**: `20200 + crc32(model_id) % 100`, deterministic per model
id. c3's Promote scaffold assigns it automatically; `promote.py` refuses a local port
that is already curated and names the replacement. Keep the compose's
`${PORT:-NNNN}` in step with the registry entry's `default_port`.

## ⚠️ What can and cannot destroy this directory

Everything here is **gitignored**, which makes it survive the operations that would
otherwise clobber it. Measured on a real clone with a model registered here:

| operation | your models |
|---|---|
| `git pull` | ✅ survive |
| `git fetch` + **`git reset --hard`** | ✅ survive |
| branch switch / `git checkout` | ✅ survive |
| `git clean -fd` | ✅ survive |
| `git stash -u` | ✅ survive |
| **`git clean -xdf`** | ❌ **DELETED — no warning, no recovery** |

**`git clean -xdf` is the one that bites.** It is the reflex command for "really clean
this repo", and its `-x` removes *ignored* files — which is exactly what this directory
is. `git clean -fd` (without `-x`) is safe; `-xdf` wipes every model you registered here.
The same applies to `git stash --all`, which stashes ignored files too.

**This directory is also not a backup.** It lives inside the checkout, and the layer is
resolved from the repo root it was imported from — so a second clone has its own empty
layer, and deleting or re-cloning this one loses everything in it. If a local model
matters to you, keep a copy outside the tree; `export_pr.py --out <dir>` (below) writes a
complete, portable bundle and is the easiest way to do that.

## Contributing a local model back to the club catalog

The local layer is a **staging ground for a contribution, not a dead end.** Once
your model is validated here, one command turns it into a ready-to-commit PR
bundle — nothing in the repo is touched, output lands only under `--out`:

```bash
python3 scripts/lib/profiles/export_pr.py --spec-file <spec>.json --check          # validate only, writes nothing
python3 scripts/lib/profiles/export_pr.py --spec-file <spec>.json --out ./bundle   # write the bundle
```

The bundle contains `models/<id>.yml`, your compose translated to the **core**
layout, and `registry-entry.yaml` (the `entries:` map in exactly the
`registry.yaml` data subset, headed by its canonical merge command).

`export_pr.py` **refuses (exit 3)** when the local model is missing what a
maintainer would bounce the PR for — a real `display_name` / `family`, a
well-formed weights map, complete registry-entry kwargs, a vLLM `kvcalc_key`, and
the compose's mandatory `Status:` header. Fix what it names and re-run.

In the cockpit this is the **`E` — Export as PR bundle** action on the same
Promote screen (`⏎ Write LOCAL layer · C WRITE CORE REGISTRY · E Export as PR bundle`).
