#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-setup-verify-count.sh — #857: setup.sh must never count an unverifiable
# file as SHA-verified.
#
# The defect: `_verify_downloaded_files` printed `SKIP (no etag)` when the etag
# lookup came back empty, did NOT count it as a failure, and then printed
# `[done] N file(s) SHA-verified` with N including every skipped file. So the
# reassuring line was emitted over files that nothing had checked.
#
# Compounding it, the lookup used a redirect-FOLLOWING `curl -sfI`. On a
# Xet-backed repo the 302 lands on the CAS bridge, whose response carries the
# CAS blob ETag and no `x-linked-etag` — the canonical sha256 lives on the FIRST
# hop. So on modern repos the SKIP was the NORMAL outcome, not a rare edge, and
# `downloader.py` hard-failed the identical case. Two surfaces, two meanings of
# "verified", and the weaker one printed the comforting message. Same failure
# shape as the historical "DONE (hash-verified)" silent-corruption incident.
#
# Asserted here (hermetic — no network, no downloads, no GPU):
#   1. the redirect-following curl etag lookup is GONE from setup.sh, and the
#      lookup delegates to hf_fetch.resolve_head (#855's no-redirect opener)
#      rather than carrying a second implementation;
#   2. an all-hashed pull reports every file verified;
#   3. a file with NO published hash is reported UNVERIFIED and is EXCLUDED
#      from the verified count — this is the defect itself;
#   4. the word "verified" NEVER attaches to a size-only observation (the same
#      rule test-pull-verify-in-place.sh asserts for the downloader surfaces);
#   5. a hash MISMATCH still hard-fails;
#   6. a SIZE mismatch on a hashless file hard-fails too — it is the only
#      cross-check left, so a failure there is real evidence of corruption.
