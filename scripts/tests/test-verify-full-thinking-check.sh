# test-verify-full-thinking-check.sh — verify-full [7/10] must pass a healthy concise
# thinker and still fail the real faults.
#
# WHY: [7/10] asked "What is 2+2?" and FAILED any reasoning under 50 chars. Concise or
# adaptive thinkers answer that with a line of thought or none, so healthy boots scored
# 9/10: ThinkingCap-Qwen3.8 (41 chars, #1418) and MiMo-V2.6 (empty, flaky). The check
# exists to prove thinking engaged and was parsed into its own field; short reasoning
# plus an answer proves exactly that.
#
# This runs the REAL `check_thinking` from scripts/verify-full.sh (extracted, not
# copied) with `curl` stubbed to serve each response shape, and checks the verdict.
# NEGATIVE CONTROL: against the pre-fix verify-full the short-reasoning case fails.
