# Stress / boundary-case test — for KV-cache and prefill-activation-memory
# stress paths that take real time to run. Split out from verify-full.sh
# 2026-04-28 so the fast functional smoke (verify-full.sh) stays under
# ~2 min while these heavier boundary tests are run only when needed.
#
# Run before publishing, after any major patch / vLLM image bump, or when
# investigating prefill-OOM regressions specifically.
#
# This is SLOW (large prompts, long-ctx needle ladder from ~10K up to
# ~92% of CTX_SIZE, ~25K-token tool prefill) — allow ~10–20 minutes on
# dual-card, longer on single-card configurations where the longest depths
# get rejected by the engine pre-check (HTTP 400, treated as graceful skip).
#
# Checks (in order — Cliff 2 territory deferred to last, ceiling rung last):
#   1. Long-context needle SMALL rungs (10K + 30K) — recall ladder at 2
#      depths that DON'T hit Cliff 2. Each depth gets its own random secret
#      to defeat caching. Depths above the deployed --max-model-len are
#      gracefully skipped via the engine's HTTP 400 pre-check.
#   2. Tool response prefill OOM — multi-turn payload with ~25K-token mock
#      tool message + tool definition + auto tool_choice; catches the
#      activation-memory peak class of bug.
#   3. IDE-agent one-shot — synthetic Cline/OpenCode-shape prompt: ~5K-char
#      sys preamble + 10 tool schemas + ~350-char user request + max_tokens=2000.
#      Catches Cliff 1 mech B (inductor compile-path FFN intermediate leak).
#   4. Multi-turn agent — sys + tools + user → assistant tool_call → tool reply
#      → user followup. Different inductor compile path than single-turn (#3).
#   5. LCB-coding shape — LeetCode-style problem statement + structured plan
#      request + max_tokens=4096. Catches DS conv state crash class.
#   6. Reasoning-heavy — math/algorithm problem + max_tokens=8192 to give the
#      model real reasoning room. Stresses spec-decode AL collapse + mamba
#      cache_mode='align' interactions.
#   7. Long-context needle LARGE rungs (60K + 90K) — Cliff 2 territory.
#      On 24 GB single-card, 60K+ single-prompt may crash the engine (DeltaNet
#      GDN forward state OOM). Putting it late preserves engine liveness for
#      probes 2-6. On dual-card or higher-VRAM rigs that can carry 60K+ this
#      passes.
#   8. Context CEILING ladder (CTX_SIZE-scaled, #199) — staggers NIAH rungs
#      from ~95K tokens up to ~92% of n_ctx in ~30K increments (configurable
#      via CEILING_STEP_TOKENS). Each rung captures VRAM before/after so you
#      get a margin curve, not just pass/fail. Stops at the first failure —
#      that depth IS the real ceiling. Catches the false-ceiling class of bug
#      (#197: hermes agent OOM at 127K on a compose that "passed" at 90K).
#      Example ladder for a 262K compose: 95K → 125K → 155K → 185K → 215K → 241K.
#
# Usage:
#   CONTAINER=<your-container> bash scripts/verify-stress.sh
#   CONTAINER=<your-container> bash scripts/verify-stress.sh --save-json results/stress-curve.json
#
# --save-json <path> (#1017): persist the prefill-vs-depth curve — one record
#   per NIAH rung (depth, recall ✓/✗, prefill t/s, cache-hit delta) — so a
#   ~45-min run's most reusable output stops evaporating with stdout.
#   Finalized on EXIT: completed rungs survive even a mid-ladder crash.
#
# Env (optional):
#   URL                    Default: registry-derived for qwen3.6-27b (curated
#                          DEFAULTS walk; currently :8020)
#   MODEL                  Default: auto-detected from /v1/models, else
#                          qwen3.6-27b
#   CONTAINER              Default: vllm-qwen36-27b
#   SKIP_LONGCTX           Set to 1 to skip the long-context needle ladder.
#   SKIP_TOOL_PREFILL      Set to 1 to skip the tool-response prefill test.
#   SKIP_CEILING           Set to 1 to skip the context ceiling ladder (#199).
#   STRESS_FAST            Set to 1 for the A/B-tier fast mode (#246): skips
#                          probe 7's large fresh needles and caps the ceiling
#                          ladder at 2 rungs (~2/3 anchor + ceiling). Roughly
#                          halves wall time; full mode stays the gate default.
#   PREFILL_TARGET_CHARS   Tool-response prefill payload size in chars
#                          (default: 100000 ≈ 25K tokens; set higher to
#                          push closer to the cliff under investigation).
#   STRESS_REASONING_TIMEOUT_S  Client timeout (s) for probe 6's reasoning-
#                          heavy request (default: 600). Raise on slow-decode
#                          configs (CPU-offload MoE, big models at low TPS) —
#                          8192 reasoning tokens at ~12 tok/s needs ~700s+,
#                          so the default times out a HEALTHY server there.
#                          Same pattern as verify-full's VERIFY_LONG_TIMEOUT.
#   CEILING_FRACTION       Fraction of n_ctx to target for the top ceiling
#                          rung (default: 0.92). Lower to test a safer fill.
#   CEILING_STEP_TOKENS    Token increment between ceiling ladder rungs
#                          (default: 30000). Smaller = more precise wall
#                          location but more rungs (each rung is a full
#                          NIAH request at that depth).
#   CEILING_START_TOKENS   First ceiling rung target in tokens (default:
#                          95000 — just above probe 7's ~90K). The ladder
#                          starts here and steps up by CEILING_STEP_TOKENS
#                          until CEILING_FRACTION × n_ctx.
#   VRAM_MARGIN_MB         Minimum free-VRAM (MB) required after a ceiling
#                          rung. Below this → warn even on HTTP 200.
#                          (default: 1024 = 1 GB; absorbs agent checkpoint
#                          overhead that single-shot NIAH doesn't exercise).
#   STRESS_LONGCTX_TIMEOUT_S       Curl timeout for long-context needle checks
#                          (default: 300, auto-bumped to 600 if container has
#                          VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER=1 — eager prefill at 60K+ can
#                          take 200-290s, see easel #102 follow-up).
#   STRESS_TOOL_PREFILL_TIMEOUT_S  Curl timeout for tool-prefill OOM check
#                          (default: 240, auto-bumped to 480 if container has
#                          VLLM_ENFORCE_EAGER=1).
