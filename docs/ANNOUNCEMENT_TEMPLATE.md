# Announcement template

The skeleton for a **"we shipped X" post** in the GitHub **Announcements** discussion category — the kind of post that introduces a newly-shipped compose/model, reports its numbers, and tells people how to run it.

It's the *wrapper* around a [Results Card](RESULTS_CARD.md): the Results Card is the measured-numbers panel (Serving · Quality · Takeaways); the announcement adds the framing, install steps, credits, and the "what'd help" ask around it. Don't duplicate the Results Card spec here — author that panel per [`RESULTS_CARD.md`](RESULTS_CARD.md) and drop it into the middle of this skeleton.

**Reference example:** [discussion #350 — Deckard-40B](https://github.com/noonghunna/club-3090/discussions/350) (the canonical fully-worked post this template is distilled from).

## When to use it

- A new compose / model graduates to the catalog (🧪 or ✅) and you want users to know it exists.
- A meaningful capability or finding ships (a new spec-dec path, a quant tier, a cross-rig-portable result).

For a *reply* answering a specific question (e.g. "where's the X YAML?"), you can lead with a one-line answer to the asker, then drop the announcement body underneath — the post still works as a standalone announcement.

## Section order

| # | Section | Purpose | Skip when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Update banner** (italic, above `---`) | Only on edits — "promoted 🧪 → ✅", "added cross-rig numbers". States *what changed and when*. | First publish. |
| 1 | **Intro** — what shipped, one sentence | Name the slug in **bold**, the model, the engine, the topology. Credit the model/quant/drafter authors inline (`@handle` + HF link) — capability that isn't ours gets attributed up front. | Never. |
| 2 | **Headline finding** | The single most interesting result, one line — the reason someone keeps reading. | Never. |
| 3 | **🎴 Results Card** | The measured panel — ① Serving ② Quality (full 8-pack `/150`) ③ Takeaways. Author per [`RESULTS_CARD.md`](RESULTS_CARD.md) — **v2**: the Quality table carries Std / CV / p50 / p95 and states `repeat = N`; Serving carries KV quality class, ctx/slot, power cap, three-layer interconnect and acceleration state. | Never — numbers are the point. |
| 4 | **Why / context** | Why this model/config is worth shipping — the workload it serves, the trade it makes. (#350's "Why an uncensored model?" / "Why it's Production".) | A trivially-obvious ship. |
| 5 | **Getting it** | Where the weights live (public HF repo + `hf download`), whether `setup.sh`/`launch.sh` auto-fetch, any engine-version floor. | — |
| 6 | **Run it** | The exact `switch.sh` / `gpu-mode` command, the port + served model name, OWUI wiring. Copy-pasteable. | — |
| 7 | **Run the evals** | How to reproduce/contribute numbers: build the benchlocal sandboxes → `quality-test.sh` (8-pack, both thinking) + `report.sh --full` (operational). Two non-overlapping passes. | A non-servable / one-off artifact. |
| 8 | **What'd help** | The concrete cross-rig / follow-up ask. Call out the *portable* finding (what holds beyond our rig). | — |
| 9 | **Credits** | Model author · quant/drafter author · engine — each `@handle` + link. Restates §1 attribution in full. | No third-party work involved. |

### ③ Takeaways
- **<headline verdict>** — the most important finding.
- <comparison / tradeoff>
- <production / stability / topology note>

<!-- §4 why / context -->
## Why <this model / config>?
<the workload it serves, the trade it makes>

<!-- §5 getting it -->
## Getting it
The weights are public: **[<org/Repo>](<hf-link>)**. <auto-fetch note: setup.sh/launch.sh fetch it, or `hf download <org/Repo>`>. You'll want <engine + min version> for <the feature>.

<!-- §6 run it -->
## Run it
\`\`\`bash
bash scripts/switch.sh --owui <engine>/<slug>   # launches on :<port> and wires Open WebUI
\`\`\`
Serves an OpenAI-compatible API on **`:<port>`** (model `<served-name>`). Point any OpenAI client at it.

<!-- §7 run the evals -->
## Run the evals yourself (or add your rig to the matrix)
Two **non-overlapping** passes — behavioral quality (the 8-pack) + operational health (verify / stress / soak / bench / agentic):
- **One-time:** `pip install git+https://github.com/noonghunna/benchlocal-cli.git`, then `git clone` it + `bash benchlocal-cli/tools/build-sandboxes.sh` (~30 GB; builds the 3 Docker sandbox packs — bugfind, cli-40, hermesagent).
- **Quality (both modes):** `bash scripts/quality-test.sh --full --no-thinking` then `--enable-thinking`. ⚠️ Thinking model → boot the compose with reasoning parsing on (`REASONING=on` for llama.cpp, `--reasoning-parser` for vLLM) for the reasoning-ON leg, so `<think>` lands in reasoning_content not the graded answer.
- **Operational:** `bash scripts/report.sh --full` (redacted, paste-ready bundle).
Non-overlapping by design — `quality-test.sh` is behavioral-only, `report.sh --full` is operational-only. Ask contributors to paste the `report.sh` bundle + their 8-pack totals in a comment or the `numbers-from-your-rig` template.

<!-- §8 ask -->
## What'd help
<cross-rig numbers / long-ctx / behaviour notes>. The portable finding: **<what holds beyond our rig>**.

<!-- §9 credits -->
## Credits
- **The model:** [**@<author>**](<link>) — <what>.
- **The <quant/drafter>:** [**@<author2>**](<link>) — <what>.
- **The engine:** [<engine>](<link>) — <feature / PR #>.
```

## Rules

- **Attribute third-party work up front and in Credits** — model authors, quant/drafter authors, engine PRs. Capability that isn't ours gets named twice (intro + Credits), not buried.
- **Numbers must be measured** — the Results Card is the empirical core; follow [`RESULTS_CARD.md`](RESULTS_CARD.md)'s rules (core 8-pack is exactly `/150`, spec-dec is its own column, state the `n`, reproduce sampling/pin/thinking in the footnote).
- **State `repeat = N` on the Quality table, always** — including when it is 1, where Std/CV render `—`. `repeat ≥ 3` is encouraged for an announcement (it is the headline post for that config) but not gated: it triples 8-pack runtime. Keep the raw benchlocal output in the collapsed `Raw data` block — a claimed score nobody can audit is not a receipt.
- **State the lifecycle honestly** — 🧪 / ✅ / 👁️ — and *why* (a rolling pre-release engine pin keeps a fully-validated compose 🧪; say so).
- **Pre-post checklist** (same as RESULTS_CARD §"Posting to a public discussion/issue"): grep the draft for internal absolute paths / model-store paths / tokens; don't link untracked/experimental composes (they 404 — describe in prose or link the image tag); verify every repo link with `git ls-tree` and every image tag with `docker manifest inspect`.
- **Lead with the ask if it's a reply** — when answering a specific question, give the one-line answer first, then the announcement body.
