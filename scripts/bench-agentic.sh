#
# Agentic prefill stress benchmark.
#
# Simulates a multi-turn coding-agent session and measures TTFT + decode TPS
# as context accumulates over N turns of tool calls. This is the relevant
# workload for Cline / Cursor / Claude Code — NOT single large prompts.
#
# Why this matters:
#   bench.sh uses single-prompt, single-turn requests. It measures decode
#   throughput but does NOT stress incremental prefill — the cost that
#   dominates every round >5 in a real coding session.
#
#   On standard-attention engines, TTFT may stay roughly flat after warmup
#   when cached context can be reused. On DeltaNet/SSM hybrid models served
#   through vLLM, the recurrent SSM state is not prefix-cacheable, so TTFT can
#   grow O(n) with accumulated context even when attention KV caching works.
#   Treat this as a per-(engine, arch_class, config) curve-shape producer, not
#   a universal cache verdict.
#
# Fixture:
#   scripts/fixtures/agentic-bench-fixture.json — 15 turns of real tool
#   call results extracted from an actual Claude Code session against this
#   repo (filesystem paths redacted). The payload is opaque context used only
#   to grow prompt depth; this script does not parse fixture paths or commands
#   as live config. Sizes range from 300 chars (ls output) to 35K chars (large
#   file reads), reaching ~53K accumulated prompt tokens by turn 15.
#
# Cliff 2 context (vLLM DeltaNet observation — llama.cpp is not affected):
#   Qwen3.6-27B is a DeltaNet/Mamba hybrid. The DeltaNet SSM recurrent
#   state CANNOT be prefix-cached — it must be recomputed from the full
#   sequence on every turn. On one measured vLLM single-card 24 GB
#   Qwen3-Next cell, TTFT degraded noticeably above ~35K accumulated tokens
#   and requests timed out around ~74K. Treat those as informational
#   per-arch_class observations, not universal thresholds.
#
# Ramp robustness (#255):
#   The context ramp is driven by tool_choice='required' turns but does NOT
#   depend on tool-call success. If the model fails to emit a parseable tool
#   call at depth (intermittent on some parsers/configs), the turn synthesizes a
#   tool call so the prompt keeps growing by the same fixed ~chars (the fixture
#   tool_result is injected regardless) — the miss is logged + counted, but the
#   ramp reaches the configured TURNS so the ~35K degrade zone is observed
#   regardless of tool-call reliability. Only genuine transport errors
#   (HTTP / timeout) stop the ramp. See the per-turn `tool_call_missed` flag and
#   the "tool-call misses" summary line.
#
# Output:
#   Per-turn table (turn, prompt_tokens, ttft_ms, decode_tps)
#   TTFT growth analysis: flat = low incremental prefill; linear = O(n)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/bench-agentic.sh
#   SESSIONS=3 bash scripts/bench-agentic.sh       # 3 sessions for stats
#   TURNS=10 bash scripts/bench-agentic.sh         # stop at turn 10
#   QUIET=1 bash scripts/bench-agentic.sh          # suppress per-req lines
#
# Env vars:
#   URL          Endpoint. Default: auto-detect running service, else bench.sh fallback
#   MODEL        Served model name. Default: auto-detected from /v1/models
#   CONTAINER    For GPU + spec-decode log scrape. Default: auto-detect
#   SESSIONS     Sessions to run (for per-turn TTFT statistics). Default: 2
#   TURNS        Turns per session (1-15). Default: 12
#   QUIET        Set to 1 to suppress per-request status lines. Default: 0
#   DECODE_GRANULARITY
#                How this model emits tokens, which decides whether decode_TPS
#                means anything at all (#809 — same contract as bench.sh).
#                  auto   (default) classify from the measured turns
#                  token  autoregressive — decode_TPS is a decode rate
#                  canvas block diffusion (dLLM): the model denoises a whole
#                         canvas in parallel and the endpoint emits ~one chunk
#                         per canvas, so TTFT == wall on any response that fits
#                         in one block and the decode window is zero-width.
#                         decode_TPS is NOT a decode rate for this class.
#   BENCH_DEGEN_WINDOW_FRAC
#                A turn whose decode window is below this fraction of its own
#                wall time has no measurable decode rate and prints n/a rather
#                than a number. Default: 0.05 — an AR decode window is ~the
#                whole wall, so this sits ~20x from any AR turn.

    # --- decode-window guard (#809, mirroring bench.sh's #854 fix) ----------
    # `decode_TPS = toks / (wall - TTFT)` assumes token-by-token AR streaming.
    # A canvas-granularity (block-diffusion) model denoises a whole canvas in
    # parallel and the SSE endpoint emits ~ONE chunk per completed canvas: a
    # response that fits in a single canvas arrives as one chunk, TTFT == wall,
    # and the decode window is zero-width. The old `max(wall - ttft, 1e-6)`
    # divided by an epsilon and printed eleven turns at 409,726 -> 1,808,323 TPS
    # while only turn 12 read plausibly (#809, real output).
    #
    # The guard is a RATIO, not an absolute threshold, and that is what makes it
    # safe for AR models: a real AR decode window IS essentially the whole wall,
    # so 5% sits ~20x away from any autoregressive turn and cannot fire on one.
    # None means UNMEASURABLE — not slow, not zero.
    decode_s = wall - ttft
    # ⛔ THE WINDOW/WALL RATIO IS RETIRED AS A HEALTH SIGNAL (2026-09-08).
    # window/wall == decode/(prefill+decode), so it encodes ANSWER LENGTH and
    # CONTEXT SIZE, not throughput: at 21K prompt (~28s prefill) a perfectly
    # healthy 60-token tool call decodes in 1.2s = 4% of wall and trips a 5%
    # threshold. No threshold value fixes that — the metric is measuring the
    # wrong thing. It is kept ONLY to guard the genuinely zero-width case
    # (decode_s <= 0), which is arithmetic, not a heuristic.
    #
    # What actually produces few-chunk turns here is FRONTEND coalescing: the
    # Qwen3 tool parser re-scans the whole accumulated argument text on every
    # delta (3 passes, no structural-char gate), ~3.2 ms/delta at 20K chars
    # ≈ 8s of API-server CPU for one long tool argument. That runs on the same
    # event loop as the engine's output handler, so outputs queue and
    # RequestOutputCollector MERGES them into a few large SSE chunks. That is a
    # frontend cost, NOT a decode collapse, and it must not be reported as one.
    #
    # Healthy streaming is ~1 chunk per engine step (1 token/step without
    # speculation, 1..n+1 with it). Far fewer chunks than tokens ⇒ the client
    # saw coalesced output — its OWN category, never "decode collapse".
    # A single chunk means there is NO OBSERVABLE decode window — you cannot time
    # an interval from one sample. That is the dLLM/canvas case (#809), and it is
    # a statement about what was observed, not a threshold on how fast it was.
