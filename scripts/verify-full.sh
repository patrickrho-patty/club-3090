# Full-functional test — fast functional smoke covering server reachability,
# patch application, basic completion, tool calling, streaming, thinking
# mode, output quality / cascade detection, and MTP acceptance verification.
# Run before publishing or after any major patch / vLLM image bump.
#
# This is the FAST functional check (~1-2 min). It does NOT exercise long-
# context recall or large prefill activation peaks — for those run
# `bash scripts/verify-stress.sh` (5-10 min, KV-cache + prefill boundary tests).
#
# Checks (in order):
#   1. Server reachable
#   2. Genesis patches applied
#   3. Basic completion (Paris)
#   4. Tool calling (KNOWN TO FAIL in default compose; PASS in tools variants)
#   5. Streaming (SSE) — non-tool prompt, verify chunks add up to coherent text
#   6. Thinking mode — reasoning prompt, verify reasoning + content both populated
#   7. Output quality / cascade detection — 2K-token completion, scan for
#      <tool_call> inline cascade and repetitive degeneracy
#   8. MTP acceptance length — parse SpecDecoding metrics from docker logs,
#      assert mean AL >= 2.0 (sanity that spec-decode is contributing)
#
# For boundary / stress validation (longctx needle ladder, ~25K-token tool
# prefill OOM detection): see scripts/verify-stress.sh
#
# Usage:
#   CONTAINER=<your-container> bash scripts/verify-full.sh
#   MTP_ACCEPT_MIN=1.8 bash scripts/verify-full.sh  # profile-specific measured floor
#
# Env (optional):
#   URL          Default: registry-derived for qwen3.6-27b (curated DEFAULTS
#                walk; currently :8020)
#   MODEL        Default: auto-detected from the endpoint's /v1/models, else
#                qwen3.6-27b
#   CONTAINER    Default: vllm-qwen36-27b
#   SKIP_TOOLS   Set to 1 to skip the tool-call test entirely (useful when
#                running against the default config which is known to fail
#                tool calls — see README "Known issue" section).
#   VERIFY_THINK_OFF / VERIFY_THINK_ON
#                Raw JSON objects for chat_template_kwargs, overriding the
#                auto-detected reasoning switch. Example for a model whose
#                template uses an effort dial rather than a boolean:
#                  VERIFY_THINK_OFF='{"reasoning_effort": "none"}'
#                Auto-detection handles the known families — set these only for
#                a template this harness does not recognise. Setting one also
#                suppresses the matching top-level OpenAI `reasoning_effort`
#                parameter, so an override fully specifies the request.
#   VERIFY_TOK_SCALE
#                Multiplier for the two short scored checks' token budgets.
#                Applied ONLY when no reasoning off-switch was detected
#                (default 64); models with a working switch are unaffected.
#
# Optional flag:
#   --bench      After all correctness checks pass, run scripts/bench.sh
#                (3 warmup + 5 measured) to report wall_TPS / decode_TPS /
#                TTFT mean+std+CV. Adds ~1-2 minutes.
