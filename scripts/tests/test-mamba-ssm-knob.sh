# test-mamba-ssm-knob — the Qwen3.8-family vLLM composes must expose a WORKING SSM-state dtype knob.
#
# WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
# --------------------
# These composes shipped `MAMBA_CACHE_DTYPE=bfloat16`, documented as "store conv+ssm state in bf16".
# It never moved the SSM state: for Qwen3.5-family models vLLM (Qwen3_5ForConditionalGenerationConfig)
# copies the HF config's `mamba_ssm_dtype` (float32) into `--mamba-ssm-cache-dtype` whenever that is
# `auto`, so `--mamba-cache-dtype` alone only changes the tiny conv state. A clean boot, a plausible
# log line, and a knob that did nothing for the part that matters.
#
# `MAMBA_SSM_CACHE_DTYPE` → `--mamba-ssm-cache-dtype` is the lever that works (+11.2% KV pool on the
# dual-fast tier, measured 2026-09-24). This guard keeps it wired, keeps the comment honest, and runs
# each compose's REAL entrypoint block to prove the default and the override resolve as documented:
#   every Qwen3.8-family vLLM compose (14 MTP + 24 DFlash): default bfloat16, `auto` reverts
#   to the model's float32, and every `exec vllm serve` line actually passes MAMBA_ARGS.
#   the CUDA-graph memory estimate is off by default on the two dual-fast composes and on
#   vllm/qwen38-27b-single-fast ONLY (its lean tier was sized and validated with it off: 81,920
#   context, a 79,813-token prompt and verify-stress on one 3090, 2026-10-02 — turning it on
#   takes ~0.5 GiB from the KV pool and that context would no longer fit).
